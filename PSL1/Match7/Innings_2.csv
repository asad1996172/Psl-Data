0.5,"Mohammad Asghar to Wright, 1 run, Asghar takes it on himself and fluffs a catch. Tossed up on off, Wright tunes up for a lofted hit. He can only skew it in the air. This is a skier. Asghar calls for it and runs towards the cover region. The ball swirls away from his reach even as he puts in a full-stretch dive",
0.6,"Mohammad Asghar to Ahmed Shehzad, 1 run, chopped off the back foot towards point",

4.3,"Shahid Afridi to Wright, no run, Afridi fires this darts, sliced to point off an outside edge",

5.6,"Wahab Riaz to Sarfraz Ahmed, no run, another mix-up between the wickets. KP isn't happy. Short and slanting away outside off from over the wicket, punched into the cover region. Yes-no, yes-no and they decide against the single, and get away",
