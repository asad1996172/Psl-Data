0.1,"Junaid Khan to Gayle, OUT, and that's a way to start the innings...What a superb ball was that, first ball duck for the big man Gayle. This was a fullish one which swung back in touch around the off stump and Gayle was quite late to get his bat down to jab that down. Ball sneaks through and clatters the stumps and out comes the zing bails. That's a delight of every bowler when you have Gayle as a batsman. Fast, quick and a bit of swing..That's the story of Gayle for tonight..",['CH Gayle b Junaid Khan 0 (1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00']
