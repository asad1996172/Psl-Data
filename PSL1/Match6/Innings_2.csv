2.6,"Mohammad Sami to Imad Wasim, no run, another swing, another miss. No feet movement whatsoever as he looks to go over cover",
3.1,"Saeed Ajmal to Vince, OUT, he's struck gold first ball. Gets some drift, pitches on off, breaks back in sharply, gets a bit of fizz as well, Vince looks to whip it past midwicket, is a touch late on the stroke and is trapped plumb in front. Would've crashed into middle and leg. Ajmal is delighted, his team mates are unstoppable. What a start this by Islamabad United",
3.2,"Saeed Ajmal to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, gets to the pitch of the ball and works it down to long on",['JM Vince lbw b Saeed Ajmal 2 (11b 0x4 0x6) SR: 18.18']
3.3,"Saeed Ajmal to Imad Wasim, FOUR, sees the flight, his eyes light up as he steps out and hammers it back over the bowler's head. It wasn't too far away from the umpire. He had to take evasive action very quickly",

4.3,"Rumman Raees to Imad Wasim, FOUR, wonderful stroke. This one was a half-volley outside off, bat nicely down, nice high elbow, opened the blade a touch to piece the gap between cover and mid-off. Delightful timing. Wasim is on a roll",

11.4,"Russell to Iftikhar Ahmed, 2 runs, this one's been deposited into the vacant deep midwicket region, two fielders circling around that but landed between them. Got too much elevation as he looked to hit that slower delivery into Abu Dhabi",

The fielder in the deep came running in, held his balance, got down on one knee and managed to take the catch even as the momentum of the ball threatened to take him back.

19.4,"Watson to Mohammad Amir, 1 run, backs away and squeezes it to extra cover",
19.5,"Watson to Bopara, SIX, a high full toss on middle, he swings that over the bowler's head, sails over long-off. Bopara, you beauty! Watson looked to bowl a yorker, missed it by a long way. What timing on that one",
