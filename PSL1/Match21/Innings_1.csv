0.2,"Hasan Ali to Bismillah Khan, OUT, Lobbed to point. Bairstow comes into action, almost rightaway, as does Hasan Ali. Banged in shortish and outside off, Bismillah goes for an agricultural swipe over the leg side. He ends up skying a catch to point off a top edge",['Bismillah Khan c Bairstow b Hasan Ali 0 (2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00']
0.3,"Hasan Ali to Ahmed Shehzad, no run, Shehzad shows his ace early as he walks out, Ali digs it even shorter and may have pinged the glove",
0.4,"Hasan Ali to Ahmed Shehzad, no run, pitched up and nips away in the channel, Shehzad does not chase it",
0.5,"Hasan Ali to Ahmed Shehzad, no run, this does not bounce in the channel. But Hasan Ali sustains the away movement. Left alone again",

3.6,"Mohammad Asghar to Sangakkara, no run, steps out and eases it to cover",

17.6,"Wahab Riaz to McCullum, OUT, short and on the leg stump, N-Mac goes for a pull but can't manufacture his own pace. The slower short ball is pulled feebly to deep midwicket. N-Mac got more height than desired distance",
