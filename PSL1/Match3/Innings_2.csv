Ball,Commentary,Wicket
0.1,"Tait to Watson, no run, hello, hello. We have some outswing at probably near 150 kph. Started just outside off, tempted Watson into a drive, squarede him up and then curled past the edge",
0.2,"Tait to Watson, 1 run, looks for the yorker on middle and leg and Watson just about blocks it. Single into the leg side",
0.3,"Tait to Sharjeel Khan, FOUR, hammered over mid-on! Comes onto the bat nicely at that pace when he bowls a short ball that barely rises to his stomach.",
0.4,"Tait to Sharjeel Khan, FOUR, lifts his front leg up, swivels on the back one and pulls through midwicket.",
0.5,"Tait to Sharjeel Khan, OUT, how about that? This is a 145.7 length ball that Sharjeel mistakes for a short one. Adrenaline running high for both men, but the batsman succumbs to it while the bowler manages to harness it. Hits the target, raises his hand in triumph and stares at the departing batsman with disdain",['Sharjeel Khan b Tait 8 (3b 2x4 0x6) SR: 266.66']
0.6,"Tait to Babar Azam, no run, 142 kph, a few howlers, a couple of jaffas. The standard Tait over. This one roots the batsman on leg stump, Azam attempts a block, is awfully squared up and feels the back of a length ball zip past his outside edge. Unplayable",
1.1,"Junaid Khan to Watson, no run, full on off stump, driven to mid-off",
1.2,"Junaid Khan to Watson, FOUR, just a tad short, just a slight bit of room, just a delightful cut shot. Saw the potential for the boundary so early and then his hands took over",
1.3,"Junaid Khan to Watson, no run",
1.4,"Junaid Khan to Watson, no run",
1.5,"Junaid Khan to Watson, FOUR, fuller ball outside off, hit hard and hit straight down the ground.",

2.1,"Tait to Babar Azam, no run, looks for the yorker on off stump, driven into the covers",
2.2,"Tait to Babar Azam, no run, goes short and just a shade outside off, Azam looks for the up and over shot past point. Beaten for pace",
2.3,"Tait to Babar Azam, no run, superb bowling. He has always been so good with the awayswinger. This is 140 kph, hitting a good length on off stump, making the batsman play, making him squared up and beating him all ends up. Rippah!",
2.4,"Tait to Babar Azam, no run, not sure slogging at a length ball outside off and being made to look ugly was the plan",
2.5,"Tait to Babar Azam, no run, back of a length on off stump, defended",
2.6,"Tait to Babar Azam, no run, short and outside off, patted through the covers",
3.1,"Mohammad Asghar to Watson, no run, down the track and hammered right back at the bowler, has to be called a catch that was missed.",
3.2,"Mohammad Asghar to Watson, 1 run, good length ball outside off, defended to point for a quick single",
3.3,"Mohammad Asghar to Babar Azam, OUT, oh dear, he's thrown it away too. Was roughed up by Tait and tries to break the shackles against the spinner. Runs down the pitch and slogs. Ends up with a mis-hit that goes straight up and lands in long-off's hands",
3.4,"Mohammad Asghar to Watson, no run, moves back against the flatter ball outside off and drives to cover. He was originally looking to cut that",['Babar Azam c Mohammad Hafeez b Mohammad Asghar 0 (8b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00']
3.5,"Mohammad Asghar to Watson, no run, pushed to mid-off, looking a little more compact",

4.3,"Junaid Khan to Watson, no run, back of a length on off stump, punched back at the bowler",
4.4,"Junaid Khan to Watson, 1 run, moves around the wicket to bowl a slower bouncer, which is doubly slower on this pitch. Watson was ready into the pull, then adjusts midway through his backlift. Gets an inside edge towards square leg",
4.5,"Junaid Khan to Umar Amin, 1 run, on the pads and worked away behind square leg",
4.6,"Junaid Khan to Watson, 1 run, fuller ball outside off, thumped to long-off",
5.1,"Mohammad Asghar to Watson, 1 run, he should have had him! Asghar duped Watson, with a little help from the pitch. It was a short ball pitching on off stump, but then it kicked up and took the top edge while he was caught in two minds with a pull shot. But the ball that shot straight up did not carry to short third man",
5.2,"Mohammad Asghar to Umar Amin, 2 runs, glided off the front foot to third man",
5.3,"Mohammad Asghar to Umar Amin, no run, gets down the track, but can only block. Asghar is bowling nice and slow",
5.4,"Mohammad Asghar to Umar Amin, OUT, well, that was simple. Amin comes down the track and chips it straight to mid-off like it was catching practice. Asghar deserves that wicket, roars in delight",
5.5,"Mohammad Asghar to Misbah-ul-Haq, FOUR, Well, that was simple too. Swept to the fine leg boundary. And they call him tuk tuk. Planted that front leg outside off and then turned the fuller ball around the corner",
5.6,"Mohammad Asghar to Misbah-ul-Haq, no run, picked up the arm ball early, stayed back and blocks ever so calmly",['Umar Amin c Junaid Khan b Mohammad Asghar 4 (6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 66.66']
6.1,"Wahab Riaz to Watson, 1 run, shortish and outside off at 140 kph, run down to third man",
6.2,"Wahab Riaz to Misbah-ul-Haq, no run, wanders outside off, Wahab follows him with a short ball which can only be bunted into the leg side",

6.4,"Wahab Riaz to Watson, no run, shortish but not wide enough to cut, Watson gets an inside edge to the wicketkeeper",
6.5,"Wahab Riaz to Watson, no run, beaten for pace. That wasn't all that short, angled across the right-hander who is caught rooted in his crease. Pokes at it half-heartedly and is lucky not to nick off",
6.6,"Wahab Riaz to Watson, 1 run, hammered away to deep point. Looked perfectly in control there and this time staying beside the ball helped him unfurl his hands better unlike the last ball because there was a little more width",
7.1,"Shahid Afridi to Watson, no run, pushes through on middle, Watson pats it back at the bowler",
7.2,"Shahid Afridi to Watson, no run, flatter ball outside off, punched into the covers",

7.5,"Shahid Afridi to Watson, no run, goes on with the arm and middle stump was in danger, but Watson is able to chop it to short third man.",
7.6,"Shahid Afridi to Watson, 1 run, pushed through on middle, clipped to midwicket and he retains strike",
8.1,"Wahab Riaz to Watson, FOUR, away she goes into the midwicket boundary. Dubai does not offer the same pace and bounce as Adelaide. Watson spins on his back foot and hammers it miles in front of square",
8.2,"Wahab Riaz to Watson, 1 leg bye, but Wahab does. This is at 147 kph, on middle and off. Skids through under Watson's pull shot and hits him in the gut. They still manage to pinch a single",
8.3,"Wahab Riaz to Misbah-ul-Haq, 1 run, shortish on middle and off, Misbah looks to move across and dab it into the leg side. Ends up with an inside edge that is deflected off his thigh pad into the off side",
8.4,"Wahab Riaz to Watson, 2 runs, shortish and outside off, pulled behind square leg",
8.5,"Wahab Riaz to Watson, OUT, straight to point! So ends this chapter of Wahab v Watson. Rather anti-climactic really. Dolly of a short ball outside off guided straight to Hafeez",
8.6,"Wahab Riaz to Billings, no run, now he goes for the fuller one, beats a flat-footed Sam Billings outside off",
9.1,"Shahid Afridi to Misbah-ul-Haq, FOUR, starts the over with a boundary, and all he had to do was use Afridi's pace. Went down to reverse sweep and picked the right ball to do so - flat and outside off.",
9.2,"Shahid Afridi to Misbah-ul-Haq, no run, pushed through on middle, defended",['SR Watson c Mohammad Hafeez b Wahab Riaz 28 (31b 4x4 0x6) SR: 90.32']
9.3,"Shahid Afridi to Misbah-ul-Haq, no run, slower through the air, Misbah sweeps to short fine leg, Billings ran three-fourths of the way down the pitch and then looks up to see his captain looking utterly perplexed. Keeper Akmal screams ""bowler!"" but Billings dives and makes his ground",

10.1,"Mohammad Asghar to Billings, 2 runs, what more can he do? Saw the batsman advancing, but held his cool, tossed it up, bowled it slow and trusted it to dip. It did dip, gripped as well and turned sharply. Billings gets an outside edge, but there is no slip",
10.2,"Mohammad Asghar to Billings, 1 run, flighted through midwicket",
10.3,"Mohammad Asghar to Misbah-ul-Haq, 1 run, tossed up outside off, pushed into the covers",
10.4,"Mohammad Asghar to Billings, 1 run, driven down the ground to long-off",
10.5,"Mohammad Asghar to Misbah-ul-Haq, OUT, Zalmi are ecstatic and United are being undone by another young left-arm spinner. This is special bowling from Asghar. His ability to slow the ball down despite the batsman moving around in the crease is such a treat to watch. Misbah had stepped outside leg to open up the off side, but Asghar held it back and when Misbah went for the loft, he gets under it too much. Caught at long-off",

11.1,"Shahid Afridi to Billings, 1 run, gets down the track and drives to long-on",
11.2,"Shahid Afridi to Ashar Zaidi, 1 run, turned away behind square leg",
11.3,"Shahid Afridi to Billings, no run, oooh, Billings goes for the reverse sweep but gets a little too close to the ball. That was a half-volley which could have been driven through cover",['Misbah-ul-Haq c Malan b Mohammad Asghar 12 (12b 2x4 0x6) SR: 100.00']
11.4,"Shahid Afridi to Billings, 1 run, tossed up on leg stump, flicked through midwicket after he had run down the track",
11.5,"Shahid Afridi to Ashar Zaidi, no run, nudged to short midwicket, Zaidi was looking for a single but has to hurry back. Great work from Tamim there",
11.6,"Shahid Afridi to Ashar Zaidi, 1 run, backs away and cuts behind point",
12.1,"Tait to Ashar Zaidi, no run, good length ball outside off, Zaidi is caught in the crease as he pushes down the pitch",

12.3,"Tait to Ashar Zaidi, OUT, that's what pace can do. This is a simple ball angled across the left-hander, but Zaidi does not move his feet and simply flashes at it. Gets a thick outside edge and Akmal takes it",
12.4,"Tait to Russell, SIX, whack! Pace don't matter to Dre Russ. Backs away against a short ball on middle and carved it away over point. That is a seriously hard shot, fellows.",
12.5,"Tait to Russell, no run, length ball outside off, Russell looks for the heave over cow corner and comes up with nothing. Now that was an easy shot, should have been put away",
12.6,"Tait to Russell, no run, yorker on the base of off stump, smeared to point",
13.1,"Shahid Afridi to Billings, 1 run, gets down the track and pushes through the covers. Billings looks a fairly decent player against spin. Lightning fast feet",
13.2,"Shahid Afridi to Russell, 3 runs, even his outside edges travel to the boundary. But Wahab has put in an amazing effort. Races after the ball, dives after it, flicks it back with his left hand and saves a run. Amid that effort, this was a really good ball from Afridi. Got it to rip away from the right hander and get his outside edge while he was playing a block",['Ashar Zaidi c †Kamran Akmal b Tait 2 (7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 28.57']
13.3,"Shahid Afridi to Billings, 2 runs, reaches out and slaps a flighted ball down to long-off",
13.4,"Shahid Afridi to Billings, 1 run, tossed up outside off, comes down the track and drives to long-off again",
13.5,"Shahid Afridi to Russell, 1 run, laced through cover as he reaches to the pitch of the ball and then holds nothing back",
13.6,"Shahid Afridi to Billings, 1 run, short ball outside off, cut away. That could well be a result of Billings' work coming down the track in the previous balls",
14.1,"Mohammad Asghar to Billings, no run, that's a sorry old short ball outside off and Billings has toe-ended it back at the bowler. How kind.",
14.2,"Mohammad Asghar to Billings, 2 runs, tossed up, but its down leg, Billings sweeps hard and collects a second as Hafee's misfields",

15.1,"Junaid Khan to Billings, SIX, whoa! He has taken a full toss from outside off and drop kicked it over square leg. What a whip of the wrists, it carried all the jolly old way!",
15.2,"Junaid Khan to Billings, 1 leg bye, goes for a sweep, getting down on one knee to put the front leg outside off. No bat, but lots of pad. Big appeal from Junaid, but since it hit the front pad, impact was outside off",
15.3,"Junaid Khan to Russell, no run, slower ball outside off, Russell swings and loses control of the bat. Beaten all ends up",
15.4,"Junaid Khan to Russell, no run, fires in the wide yorker and Russell is bent double trying to reach it. Still can't",
15.5,"Junaid Khan to Russell, 1 run, full on off stump, flayed to extra cover",
15.6,"Junaid Khan to Billings, FOUR, amazing awareness of the field. Billings is billed as an unorthodox shot maker and he is showing his full range here. Moves outside off, picks up the slower ball and scoops it over short fine leg.",
16.1,"Wahab Riaz to Russell, no run, slower short ball on middle and off, Russell goes for the hook but does not connect. Lovely lines from Wahab. Absolutely no room to work with",
16.2,"Wahab Riaz to Russell, OUT, Asghar! He can do no wrong tonight! His hands must be burning after taking that catch, but he barely even flinches. This was a short ball that Russell nails with a cut shot. Remember he hit a six first ball with this very shot and this was hurtling flat. But Asghar comes forward, dives and takes it clean as",
16.3,"Wahab Riaz to Billings, OUT, Asghar! Give him the key to Peshawar! Even if he did overrun the ball, he recovered quickly, dived to his right and takes a fine catch over his shoulder. This was a short ball outside off and Billings had cut it looking for the boundary. Doesn't get the distance. The umpires want to check the no-ball and Wahab is quite fine",
16.4,"Wahab Riaz to Imran Khalid, 1 run, back of a length on off stump, defended",

17.3,"Tait to Saeed Ajmal, 1 run, slower ball outside off, slapped to extra cover",
17.4,"Tait to Imran Khalid, no run, trampolines over the ducking batsman. Went that short because Khalid was moving outside leg",['SW Billings c Mohammad Asghar b Wahab Riaz 26 (20b 1x4 1x6) SR: 130.00']
17.5,"Tait to Imran Khalid, no run, full and slid across the left-hander, Khalid made room again and ends up not being able to reach far enough to connect with a slice",
17.6,"Tait to Imran Khalid, no run, looks for the wide yorker and finds it. Khalid chops and misses",
18.1,"Junaid Khan to Saeed Ajmal, no run, slower short ball outside off, and I think this gripped and turned past Ajmal, who was looking to pull.",
18.2,"Junaid Khan to Saeed Ajmal, OUT, they were trying to pinch a bye and a gleeful Akmal underarms the throw to knock over Khalid and breaks into the widest smile you could ever see. These slower balls are becoming more and more deadly, even to the batsman at the other end! Ajmal misses, his partner gets out",
18.3,"Junaid Khan to Rumman Raees, 1 run, shortish and outside off, guided through point and there is almost a collision between the two batsmen. Raees was ball watching",
18.4,"Junaid Khan to Saeed Ajmal, no run, shortish and slow, Ajmal looks for the pull and comes second best again",
18.5,"Junaid Khan to Saeed Ajmal, 1 run, fuller ball outside off, punched to long-on",
