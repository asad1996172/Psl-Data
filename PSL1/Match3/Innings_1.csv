0.1,"Russell to Tamim Iqbal, 1 run, fullish ball on off stump brings Tamim forward with a defensive bat. Inside edge meanders into the vacant midwicket region",
0.2,"Russell to Mohammad Hafeez, no run, short and wide outside off, cut away to deep point",
0.3,"Russell to Mohammad Hafeez, FOUR, beautiful shot! Don't know why he bothered running. Should have just stood and admired the way he had timed that cover drive. Eased forward to the fuller ball and only extended his defence",
0.4,"Russell to Mohammad Hafeez, no run, full on off stump, Hafeez was going for the drive again but he is there too early. Bat turns in his hand and a drive to mid-off ends up in the bowler's hands",
0.5,"Russell to Mohammad Hafeez, 1 run, full and down leg, Hafeez flicks it towards the long leg boundary. Neatly timed again, but Raees inside the circle does well diving to his left",
0.6,"Russell to Tamim Iqbal, no run, back of a length and outside off, slid to backward point",
1.1,"Watson to Mohammad Hafeez, 2 runs, runs at the seamer immediately, Watson pulls his length back. Flick off the pads to long leg",
1.2,"Watson to Mohammad Hafeez, no run, leading edge skews away to mid-off. Watson pitches the ball up on middle and leg, Hafeez plays the angle and looks for a clip through midwicket. Ends up squared up as he wises up to the late away swing",
1.3,"Watson to Mohammad Hafeez, FOUR, no swing there, just the angle into the pads and Hafeez dispatches the overpitched delivery to the midwicket boundary",
1.4,"Watson to Mohammad Hafeez, no run, opts for the change in pace and it keeps Hafeez to a block into the covers",
1.5,"Watson to Mohammad Hafeez, OUT, whoa! Sam Billings has claimed a ripper of a catch behind the wicket! The outside edge was thick, with Hafeez running down the track and then adjusting to the short ball by looking to guide it down to third man. The key to this was Billings taking that first step to his right, and not just diving straight away. He got a little momentum to work with before throwing himself towards the ball and taking it one-handed at full stretch.",['Mohammad Hafeez c †Billings b Watson 11 (9b 2x4 0x6) SR: 122.22']
1.6,"Watson to Malan, 1 run, shortish and angled into the left-hander from around the stumps, cut to deep third man",
2.1,"Saeed Ajmal to Malan, FOUR, ooooh, that could have been another spectacular catch! It was a short and wide delivery - the quicker delivery gone wrong - Malan goes back and cuts. Gets only a thick outside edge that goes past Watson at slip",
2.2,"Saeed Ajmal to Malan, no run, cuts and misses as Ajmal slows it down outside off. There for the shot, but Malan may be a little nervous",
2.3,"Saeed Ajmal to Malan, no run, looped up outside of, Malan is a little slow in budging that front leg towards the pitch. Goes for the drive and misses again",
2.4,"Saeed Ajmal to Malan, no run, driven into the covers, looks a lot better that time",
2.5,"Saeed Ajmal to Malan, no run, fired in flat and outside off, Malan jumps back and pushes it to cover",
2.6,"Saeed Ajmal to Malan, no run, stays back again, but with the ball coming off the deck rather slowly, Malan has to make all the pace himself. Tries to force it down the ground, but can't beat the bowler",
3.1,"Rumman Raees to Tamim Iqbal, 1 leg bye, angles the back of a length delivery into the pads, nudged to long leg",
3.2,"Rumman Raees to Malan, no run, short and wide outside off, Tamim looks for the cut but he plays under the ball. Perhaps looking to hit it too hard",
3.3,"Rumman Raees to Malan, 1 run, likes pace on the ball, does Malan. Opens the face of the bat and steers it behind point.",
3.4,"Rumman Raees to Tamim Iqbal, no run, more evidence of Tamim going hell for leather. Runs down the track and looks to slog him over long-on. Comes up with a whole lotta nothin'",
3.5,"Rumman Raees to Tamim Iqbal, 4 leg byes, speared onto the pads, hits them and runs off to the long leg boundary. Billings tried to intercept it, but even he isn't quick enough. Yorker gone just slightly wrong there.",
3.6,"Rumman Raees to Tamim Iqbal, 1 run, slower ball on middle, Tamim picks it up and slots it through midwicket",
4.1,"Saeed Ajmal to Tamim Iqbal, no run, plants his front leg across and turns it to short fine leg. There is no single there and Malan, having taken a few steps to accept Tamim's call, says no just in time",
4.2,"Saeed Ajmal to Tamim Iqbal, 1 run, that time there is the single to be taken, Tamim pats it into the covers and both batsmen go immediately",
4.3,"Saeed Ajmal to Malan, no run, backs away, so Ajmal hits a good length and bowls a ripping offspinner to be at the flat batted slice through point",
4.4,"Saeed Ajmal to Malan, no run, flighted onto off stump, very little pace to work with, a fidgety Malan defends to slip.",
4.5,"Saeed Ajmal to Malan, no run, loops it over Malan's eyeline, Malan backs away to try a square drive. Beaten",
4.6,"Saeed Ajmal to Malan, no run, goes for the drive on the up, but even Ajmal's quicker balls are getting turn on this pitch. Zips past the outside edge again",
5.1,"Rumman Raees to Tamim Iqbal, 1 leg bye, tucked into the leg side. The lack of room outside off is not allowing Tamim to get on a roll",
5.2,"Rumman Raees to Malan, OUT, he's been bogged down against Ajmal, and at the other end he gets a slightly short ball and decides it just has to go. Rocks back and pulls, doesn't keep it down and is snapped up by a diving Watson at midwicket. Don't think there was all that much room for a full swing of the arms there",
5.3,"Rumman Raees to Kamran Akmal, no run, plants the open face down on a short of a length ball to point",['DJ Malan c Watson b Rumman Raees 6 (14b 1x4 0x6) SR: 42.85']
5.4,"Rumman Raees to Kamran Akmal, 1 run, pushed to mid-off, runs with the shot before realising the fielder was the incredibly athletic Russell. Runs as hard as he can and makes it because Russell failed to pick up the ball",
5.5,"Rumman Raees to Tamim Iqbal, no run, ooh, that skidded on and stayed low. Tamim was setting up for the pull and is struck on the back thigh",
5.6,"Rumman Raees to Tamim Iqbal, no run, goes for the yorker, provides a low full toss instead, Tamim clips it straight to midwicket",
6.1,"Ashar Zaidi to Kamran Akmal, 2 runs, flighted outside off, laced through the point region. Akmal runs hard again and gets across for the second run",
6.2,"Ashar Zaidi to Kamran Akmal, no run, arm ball looking to topple middle stump, Akmal backs away and nails the cut shot. Seemed like he had the gap until the fielder makes the dive",
6.3,"Ashar Zaidi to Kamran Akmal, 1 run, pushed through on middle and off, Akmal chops it square on the off side",
6.4,"Ashar Zaidi to Tamim Iqbal, no run, tossed up on leg stump, Tamim attempts a flick and nearly falls over while the ball wanders to short fine leg",
6.5,"Ashar Zaidi to Tamim Iqbal, no run, comes down the track to try and make his own length, but Zaidi bowls it flat on off stump and refuses to give any room",
6.6,"Ashar Zaidi to Tamim Iqbal, 1 run, that time he hid his intentions well. Came down the track only after the ball was looped up, and so he is able to chip it to long-off",
7.1,"Saeed Ajmal to Tamim Iqbal, no run, oooh, beaten in flight! Ajmal bowls it slow even with the batsman running at him, gets the ball to dip on the batsman dramatically. Tamim gets a thick outside edge to short third man",
7.2,"Saeed Ajmal to Tamim Iqbal, 1 run, hey, that was a Malinga ball! Changed his action completely and just slings the ball on off stump, mis-hit to midwicket",
7.3,"Saeed Ajmal to Kamran Akmal, no run, shortish and outside off, Akmal backs away for the cut and misses",
7.4,"Saeed Ajmal to Kamran Akmal, FOUR, another slingy delivery as Ajmal sacrifices his turn, Akmal has seen it early, camps back and cuts it strongly to the cover boundary.",
7.5,"Saeed Ajmal to Kamran Akmal, OUT, should have kept it simple after a boundary like that, but Akmal gets greedy. Moves across outside off to play a sweep shot. The tossed up ball sneaks under his bat and hits his front pad in line with middle and off stump",
7.6,"Saeed Ajmal to Shahid Yousuf, FOUR, flighted on leg stump gets a powerful sweep in response. Great shot from the new batsman Yousuf so much that Ajmal looks around in bemusement, as if asking how can you do that to me?",
8.1,"Ashar Zaidi to Tamim Iqbal, 2 runs, clipped to deep square leg and he has placed it far enough from the man in the deep that there was an easy two",['Kamran Akmal lbw b Saeed Ajmal 8 (8b 1x4 0x6) SR: 100.00']
8.2,"Ashar Zaidi to Tamim Iqbal, no run, comes down the track and gets yorked as Zaidi fires it in on leg stump",
8.3,"Ashar Zaidi to Tamim Iqbal, no run, a little room outside off, that's what Tamim has been looking for all innings, but since he has been bogged down for so long, his timing is all wonky. Beaten",
8.4,"Ashar Zaidi to Tamim Iqbal, 1 run, down the track, the length has been pulled back but the line remains on middle. Flat-bat pull to long-on",
8.5,"Ashar Zaidi to Shahid Yousuf, 1 run, tossed up on middle and off, whipped away to deep midwicket",
8.6,"Ashar Zaidi to Tamim Iqbal, 2 runs, oh, well played! The bowler is giving him so much pace and Tamim finally decides to use it. Gets down on one knee in a trice and lap sweeps",
9.1,"Saeed Ajmal to Shahid Yousuf, 1 run, tossed up on off stump, pushed to long-on",
9.2,"Saeed Ajmal to Tamim Iqbal, no run, not quite short enough to cut, nor quite full enough to drive. Tamim looks for runs through point and is beaten",
9.3,"Saeed Ajmal to Tamim Iqbal, 1 run, runs down at the offspinner and heaves him over cover. His accuracy and changes of pace are still remarkable",
9.4,"Saeed Ajmal to Shahid Yousuf, 1 run, strays on the pads again and Yousuf sweeps him with great skill to the long leg fielder. Wrists roll on top of the ball to provide the power",
9.5,"Saeed Ajmal to Tamim Iqbal, 1 run, fired in on off stump, Tamim punches it into the covers and goes for a quick single. The throw comes in from extra cover, and I think Ajmal dropped the ball and flicked the bail with his hand. Went for the appeal though. Guess he didn't know",
9.6,"Saeed Ajmal to Shahid Yousuf, 1 run, fired in on off stump, defended to point. They scamper across for another quick single and had that been a direct hit, Tamim may well have been walking back",
10.1,"Ashar Zaidi to Shahid Yousuf, 1 run, goes on with the arm as Yousuf goes back and flicks through midwicket",
10.2,"Ashar Zaidi to Tamim Iqbal, 1 run, moves down leg, Zaidi follows the batsman and makes sure Tamim can only knock it down towards midwicket",
10.3,"Ashar Zaidi to Shahid Yousuf, 1 run, goes full on middle, Yousuf flicks it away to deep midwicket",
10.4,"Ashar Zaidi to Tamim Iqbal, FOUR, down the track, to the pitch, having made room outside leg and then all that was left was the full swing of the arms. Belted to the long-off boundary",
10.5,"Ashar Zaidi to Tamim Iqbal, SIX, oooh, he's miscued a six over long-off! Zaidi has his hands on his head in absolute disbelief. This can't have come off more than a thick outside edge as Tamim went for the slog over long-on having come down the track",
10.6,"Ashar Zaidi to Tamim Iqbal, 1 run, swept towards fine leg",
11.1,"Watson to Tamim Iqbal, no run, moves across outside off, Watson delivers a good length ball outside off as well, Tamim looks to tap it to deep third man but finds short third man",

12.1,"Russell to Shahid Yousuf, 1 leg bye, attempts a pull, but he does not get any bat on it. Appeared the slower short ball that thuds into his hip and then to the left of the keeper",
12.2,"Russell to Tamim Iqbal, 1 run, a sharp bouncer reaches Tamim before he is ready with his hook shot. Top edge to long leg",
12.3,"Russell to Shahid Yousuf, no run, now the yorker, homing in on the base of middle, dug out",
12.4,"Russell to Shahid Yousuf, 1 run, another yorker, this time driven to mid-off having made a little room for himself",
12.5,"Russell to Tamim Iqbal, 1 run, comes down the track, does so while getting inside the line of the back of a length ball, and then lifts it over cover",
12.6,"Russell to Shahid Yousuf, no run, full and wide, pushed into the covers. That brings us to a time out.",
13.1,"Watson to Tamim Iqbal, 1 run, fuller ball on off stump, defended to point",

13.3,"Watson to Shahid Yousuf, 1 run, banged in short, pulled away to deep square leg",
13.4,"Watson to Tamim Iqbal, no run, full and outside off, Tamim moves across to whip it over midwicket. Nowhere in position to deal with a ball at that length. There's a noise, but its not woody enough to be an edge",
13.5,"Watson to Tamim Iqbal, 2 runs, full and just outside off, drilled through the covers",
13.6,"Watson to Tamim Iqbal, 2 runs, goes for the short ball on middle and leg, Tamim pulls only as far as deep midwicket",
14.1,"Russell to Shahid Yousuf, OUT, full, straight, Yousuf misses and Russell hits. He was making room to try and hit the ball inside out, but perhaps backed away a touch too much",
14.2,"Russell to Shahid Afridi, FOUR, heaved away to the leg side boundary. That was length, Afridi cleared his front leg and smacked it between long-on and deep midwicket",['Shahid Yousuf b Russell 16 (16b 1x4 0x6) SR: 100.00']

14.4,"Russell to Tamim Iqbal, 1 run, short ball down leg, Tamim pulls to long leg",
14.5,"Russell to Shahid Afridi, no run, oooh, he really did want to cane that. Made room outside leg, that bat soaring over the top of his head in its wind up. But Russell follows him with a slower, shorter ball that allows no room. Afridi swings too early and is almost hit on the elbow after the shot completes",
14.6,"Russell to Shahid Afridi, no run, another slower ball, another dot. Offcutter from Russell, bowled wider outside off having seen Afridi move outside leg. Slog and miss",
15.1,"Rumman Raees to Tamim Iqbal, no run, ooh, shrewd bowling. Especially against a player who hasn't been in any form tonight. Tamim is beaten by a slower ball outside off",
15.2,"Rumman Raees to Tamim Iqbal, 1 run, if the last ball was full and wide, this is short and straight. Tamim tries a pull, but is too cramped to connect well. Single to deep midwicket",
15.3,"Rumman Raees to Shahid Afridi, 1 run, slower short ball, but Afridi picks it up, leaps off his feet and hacks at it. Like he was wielding an axe and not a bat. Single to deep midwicket",

15.5,"Rumman Raees to Shahid Afridi, 1 run, full on leg stump, whipped to long-on",
15.6,"Rumman Raees to Tamim Iqbal, 1 run, slower ball just outside off, slapped into the covers and Tamim has to stretch as far as he could to make his ground at the other end. Good strong throw from the fielder",
16.1,"Watson to Tamim Iqbal, FOUR, thumped to the cover boundary. That tells you that there are no demons in the pitch. Just the bad balls have been so few and far between. Width offered, at half-volley length, taken advantage of",
16.2,"Watson to Tamim Iqbal, FOUR, moves around the stumps to target them better, but it makes no difference. Drills another half-volley outside off through extra cover",
16.3,"Watson to Tamim Iqbal, 1 run, goes short at 129 kph, Tamim had moved across and looked to pull it to the fine leg boundary. Ends up with only a single to square leg",
16.4,"Watson to Shahid Afridi, SIX, low full toss, launched over long-off. Muscled away. I can almost swear that hit the bottom of his bat",
16.5,"Watson to Shahid Afridi, 1 run, finds the yorker that time, pushed past the diving bowler to long-off",
16.6,"Watson to Tamim Iqbal, 2 runs, short ball on middle and leg, pulled to deep midwicket. That makes it 18 off the over. Hugely needed for Peshawar",
17.1,"Rumman Raees to Shahid Afridi, no run, slips in the slower bouncer, Afridi was moving outside leg, spots it late, sways away and looks for the wide. No such luck",
17.2,"Rumman Raees to Shahid Afridi, 1 run, walks at the left-arm seamer, but Raees keeps his cool and bowls a slower ball outside off. Afridi has to reach out and pat it through point",
17.3,"Rumman Raees to Tamim Iqbal, 1 run, full on off stump, driven to long-off for only a single",
17.4,"Rumman Raees to Shahid Afridi, 1 run, walks at him, so Raees digs it in short. Afridi attempts a pull but can get it only to short fine leg. Lovely skill under pressure from the bowler",
17.5,"Rumman Raees to Tamim Iqbal, no run, how about that. Now he lands a yorker on middle and makes it a dot ball",
17.6,"Rumman Raees to Tamim Iqbal, 2 runs, slower ball outside off, thumped down the ground for a couple. Good work from long-off, painstaking work from Tamim to bring up his fifty. Finally his strike rate is above run-a-ball.",
18.1,"Russell to Shahid Afridi, OUT, straight up, this is a seriously tough chance, but Russell is not a man easily deterred. Calls for it himself, settles under it and watches it all the way into his hands. Afridi got the length he wanted and the width too, but gets under the ball a little too much",
18.2,"Russell to Tamim Iqbal, OUT, two in two! Tamim has dragged a slower ball from outside off to Watson at square leg. Good work from the umpire there too to duck and not interfere",
18.3,"Russell to Wahab Riaz, FOUR, searches for the hat-trick by searching for the yorker. It slides down leg though and Wahab just clips it to long leg",
18.4,"Russell to Wahab Riaz, 1 run, clipped to backward square leg",
18.5,"Russell to Sammy, 1 run, back of a length and outside off, Sammy tries to punch it through cover but it seems he has misjudged the pace on this ball. Might have held in the pitch longer to make him inside edge to long-on",['Shahid Afridi c & b Russell 16 (12b 1x4 1x6) SR: 133.33']

19.2,"Ashar Zaidi to Sammy, SIX, slow, short, begging to be hit and Sammy does not hold back. Gets the bat up high, brings it down hard and launches it over the midwicket boundary",
19.3,"Ashar Zaidi to Sammy, 2 runs, flat and outside off, Sammy lifts it to long-on and races across for a couple.",
19.4,"Ashar Zaidi to Sammy, 1 run, OUT, yorker on leg stump, pushed to long-offSammy looks for the second, but Wahab says no. The throw though goes to the other end, and the wicketkeeper Billings is not ready. Now they go for the second, without realising Ajmal was backing up. Direct hit now sends Sammy back",
