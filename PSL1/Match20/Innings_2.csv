0.1,"Ehsan Adil to Smith, no run, back of a length on off stump, blocked back to the bowler",
0.2,"Ehsan Adil to Smith, FOUR, short and wide, and he stands up tall and cracks it away crisply through point. Just rolls his wrists over at the top of the bounce and watches it run away to the boundary",
0.3,"Ehsan Adil to Smith, 1 run, full, a bit of swing in towards off stump, pushed down the ground towards mid-on",
0.4,"Ehsan Adil to Sharjeel Khan, 1 run, shortish on leg stump. Looks to pull it away but is in too closed a position and it hits his thigh pad and runs away towards short fine leg",
0.5,"Ehsan Adil to Smith, no run, yorker on middle stump, jams his bat down to dig it out into the off side",
0.6,"Ehsan Adil to Smith, 2 runs, full on middle stump, clips it towards mid-on and sets off for a single. The throw is just wide of the stumps at the bowler's end - not sure Smith would have made it if it was a direct hit - and he ends up getting an overthrow as well",
1.1,"Zia-ul-Haq to Sharjeel Khan, 1 leg bye, quickish length ball angling down leg. Can't connect with the flick and it rolls off the pad into the leg side",
1.2,"Zia-ul-Haq to Smith, FOUR, short, wide, punished. Just stands tall and slaps it away to the right of cover point",
1.3,"Zia-ul-Haq to Smith, OUT, gone! Pulls his line closer to off stump and Smith looks to cut without moving his back foot. Ends up getting a thick outside edge to the keeper",['DR Smith c †Mohammad Rizwan b Zia-ul-Haq 11 (7b 2x4 0x6) SR: 157.14']

1.6,"Zia-ul-Haq to Sharjeel Khan, 1 run, short on off stump, pulled away to deep backward square leg",
2.1,"Ehsan Adil to Sharjeel Khan, 2 runs, fullish on off stump, and that is dropped. Looks to loft it down the ground, doesn't get hold of it, and it goes high in the air over mid-off. Adnan Rasool turns around, runs towards the boundary, and looks to catch the ball dropping down from over his shoulder, and slightly overruns the ball and lets it slip through his arms",
2.2,"Ehsan Adil to Sharjeel Khan, 1 run, length ball, pushed towards mid-off",
2.3,"Ehsan Adil to Haddin, 2 runs, very full, angling into off stump, jams his bat down on it and squeezes it away to the left of third man",
2.4,"Ehsan Adil to Haddin, no run, back of a length, angling down leg. Shuffles across to flick, and the ball slips through to the keeper, who goes up in a loud appeal. Seemed to miss the inside edge and deflect off his back pad",
2.5,"Ehsan Adil to Haddin, no run, back of a length, close to off stump. Goes through at a slippery pace and beats Haddin's attempted dab to third man",
2.6,"Ehsan Adil to Haddin, FOUR, full on off stump, and Haddin brings down a straight bat, full face showing, and punches the ball back past the bowler's feet, went too quickly for him to react and bend down to field it, and it shoots away to the straight boundary",

3.2,"Zia-ul-Haq to Sharjeel Khan, OUT, not short enough to pull, and he has to drag it from outside off as well. He's a little late on the shot, and he skies it high in the air, behind the wicket, and Rizwan calls nice and early and runs to his right to pouch it safely",
3.3,"Zia-ul-Haq to Haddin, no run, back of a length close to off stump, dabbed to backward point",['Sharjeel Khan c †Mohammad Rizwan b Zia-ul-Haq 5 (7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 71.42']
3.4,"Zia-ul-Haq to Haddin, FOUR, short, rising ball over off stump. Too quick for Haddin to control his pull as he looks to take it from over his right shoulder, and gets a top edge that flies high over first slip",
3.5,"Zia-ul-Haq to Haddin, no run, back of a length outside off, angling away. Chases at it, away from his body, and can't connect",
3.6,"Zia-ul-Haq to Haddin, FOUR, fullish outside off, not quite overpitched, but the angle gave him plenty of width to bring his bat down through a smooth arc and drive crisply to the left of extra cover",
4.1,"Bravo to Khalid Latif, no run, slower ball outside off, gets forward for a poke to point",
4.2,"Bravo to Khalid Latif, no run, slower bouncer outside off. Latif shaped to pull and decided in the end to check himself and let it go through to the keeper",

4.6,"Bravo to Haddin, 1 run, slower ball, full on off stump, clipped to long-on",

5.3,"Zia-ul-Haq to Khalid Latif, FOUR, short down the leg side and that's easily put away. Fine leg was inside the circle, and he simply had to swat it away to his left",

5.5,"Zia-ul-Haq to Khalid Latif, 1 run, slower bouncer over off stump, and Latif top-edges the pull. Pops up softly in the air, too far to the right of the keeper for him to dash across and catch",

6.1,"Mendis to Khalid Latif, 1 run, length ball on off stump, gets on the front foot to push into the point region",
6.2,"Mendis to Haddin, 1 run, tossed up wide of off stump. He could have left it and picked up a wide, possibly, but he reaches out and slaps to sweeper cover instead",
6.3,"Mendis to Khalid Latif, FOUR, shortish, down the leg side, and Latif can pick up four more easy runs by just helping it to the left of short fine leg",
6.4,"Mendis to Khalid Latif, 1 run, length ball on the pads, clipped towards short fine leg",
6.5,"Mendis to Haddin, 2 runs, tossed up wide of off stump and Haddin flat-bats it back down the ground, lots of bottom hand. Was in the air to the bowler's left, but it went too quickly for him to get his hands to it. Long-off sprawls full-length to his right to stop it",
6.6,"Mendis to Haddin, 1 run, full outside off, drilled down the ground to the right of long-off",
7.1,"Delport to Haddin, FOUR, back of a length fairly wide outside off, poor ball with third man in the circle, and he simply lets it come on and dabs it to the left of that fielder",

7.3,"Delport to Khalid Latif, 1 run, length ball on middle stump, lets it come on and clips it gently into the midwicket region. They want two but Umar Akmal chases quickly from long-on to keep them down to one",

12.2,"Mendis to Haddin, no run, length ball wide of off, slapped to extra cover",
12.3,"Mendis to Haddin, OUT, down the track and he floats it up wide of off stump. Loads of confusion after Haddin flat-bats to extra cover. Azhar Ali fumbles, but there's such a huge mix-up between the batsmen that he can field the ball on the second attempt and throw to the keeper and still get Latif run-out. Haddin ran all the way to the other end, where Latif was unmoved till Azhar misfielded the ball. By the time he decided to run, it was too late",
12.4,"Mendis to Misbah-ul-Haq, FOUR, short ball outside off and that is hammered. Just stands there and pulls it away wide of long-on. Bam.",

12.6,"Mendis to Haddin, 1 run, back of a length outside off, dabbed to the left of short third man",
13.1,"Azhar Ali to Haddin, no run, down the track and that's a missed stumping. Sharp legbreak outside off, Haddin misses the inside-out drive, and Rizwan juggles the ball behind the stumps. Haddin drags his foot back, even though he drops his bat while doing so",
13.2,"Azhar Ali to Haddin, no run, and again he beats the edge. Reaches out to drive and the turn beats him. The keeper has the bails off in a flash, and Haddin's foot was momentarily in the air, but I think he's brought it down just in time",

15.4,"Bravo to Asif Ali, 1 run, high full-toss, was a slower ball. Asif didn't spot it till the last moment, ducked into it, and it dipped late to hit him on the glove when he was almost at full crouch, and ricocheted into the leg side",

16.2,"Ehsan Adil to Asif Ali, OUT, low full-toss on middle and leg, and Asif shuffles across and misses the flick. Hits low on the front pad, and that looked plumb at first glance. Hit in line with middle and leg, and would have clipped the edge of leg stump according to ball tracking",

17.1,"Bravo to Misbah-ul-Haq, no run, full on off stump, driven back firmly, hits the stumps at the other end. Bravo reached out, didn't get his fingertips to it. Otherwise, the non-striker was well out of his crease",
17.2,"Bravo to Misbah-ul-Haq, 2 runs, shortish on off stump but not quite short enough to pull. Miscued it high in the air, and Zia, the man at deep square leg, is on his heels and late to come in off the rope. Maybe he was expecting someone else to be calling for that catch. The ball lands a few feet in front of him and to his right",
17.3,"Bravo to Misbah-ul-Haq, FOUR, full-toss on the pads and that is a poor ball with fine leg in the circle. Misbah swivels at the hips and whips it away to the right of that fielder",
17.4,"Bravo to Misbah-ul-Haq, 1 run, full on leg stump, clipped away to the left of deep square leg",
17.5,"Bravo to Azhar Mahmood, no run, slower ball, full and close to off stump. Azhar looks to dab it towards point and gets a thin edge that drops short of the keeper",

18.6,"Mendis to Misbah-ul-Haq, FOUR, sees Misbah stepping across the stumps and floats it wide of off stump. Looks for that sweep again, and the top edge runs away for four, to the left of short third man",
