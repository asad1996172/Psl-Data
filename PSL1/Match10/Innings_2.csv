1.1,"Tait to Simmons, 1 run, short, angling into the ribcage, tucked away into the square leg region",
1.2,"Tait to Nauman Anwar, FOUR, looks for the yorker and the length isn't quite full enough. Nauman simply flicks it away, up and over midwicket",
1.3,"Tait to Nauman Anwar, 1 run, short, angling into the body, pulled through backward square leg",
1.4,"Tait to Simmons, no run, back of a length outside off, Simmons looks to make room and carve it away but can't put bat to ball. His weight was moving away from the ball as he played the shot",

1.6,"Tait to Nauman Anwar, 1 run, back of a length on middle and leg, defended into the midwicket region",

2.2,"Aamer Yamin to Nauman Anwar, 1 run, short, angling down leg. Can't connect with the pull, ends up inside-edging it to the left of the keeper",
2.3,"Aamer Yamin to Simmons, no run, length ball wide of off, slapped to backward point",
2.4,"Aamer Yamin to Simmons, FOUR, fullish, and again he gives up too much width. Simmons frees his arms and slams it to the right of short cover",
2.5,"Aamer Yamin to Simmons, no run, slower ball outside off, clouts it hard to the left of midwicket, where Sammy makes a good diving stop",
2.6,"Aamer Yamin to Simmons, 1 run, full on middle and off, clipped to long-on",
3.1,"Tait to Simmons, no run, fuller now, but again the line is all wrong, slings this down the leg side, maybe clips the pad on its way through to the keeper after he misses the flick",
3.2,"Tait to Simmons, no run, very full on middle stump, makes a bit of room and plays a firm drive down to mid-off",
3.3,"Tait to Simmons, 1 run, full-toss angling into the body. Looks to club it away and it rolls softly into the leg side off the inner half of his bat",
3.4,"Tait to Nauman Anwar, no run, shortish on off stump, whipped to midwicket",
3.5,"Tait to Nauman Anwar, FOUR, on the pads, and that's asking for punishment with fine leg in the circle. Just flicks it away to the left of the fielder and it simply races away",
3.6,"Tait to Nauman Anwar, no run, slower ball outside off, saw Nouman making himself room. Had to wait on it and didn't get any pace to work with, just poked it to the fielder at point",
4.1,"Wahab Riaz to Simmons, OUT, And he strikes first ball! Simmons looks to make room to hit through the off side, and he doesn't get any width, it's fuller than he would like, and the ball is through him quicker than expected, before he can bring his bat down fully",['LMP Simmons b Wahab Riaz 9 (12b 1x4 0x6) SR: 75.00']

5.1,"Mohammad Asghar to Vince, OUT, flat, angling into off stump, lets it come on and dabs towards short third man. They take on the fielder, and it's not the greatest decision as Shahid Yousuf fires in a direct hit that finds Nouman short of the crease at the keeper's end, even though he dives to get home",
5.2,"Mohammad Asghar to Imad Wasim, no run, sharp turn into him as he looks to make room, ends up blocking to short cover",['Nauman Anwar run out 14 (16b 3x4 0x6) SR: 87.50']
5.3,"Mohammad Asghar to Imad Wasim, OUT, down the track now, heaves across the line and miscues to midwicket. And what's happened here? There's another appeal for a run-out. It's gone to the third umpire. Terrible running from Imad. I can't really call it running, because he was simply walking the run, and the fielder saw this and fired in a throw at the non-striker's end. Imad doesn't ground his bat, simply looks to step into the crease, and he's out by a fair distance",
5.4,"Mohammad Asghar to Vince, no run, full on middle and off, blocked back to the bowler",
5.5,"Mohammad Asghar to Vince, FOUR, shortish outside off, and that's a fantastic shot, makes a bit of room and uses the pace to steer the ball through point. There's no one back at sweeper cover",['Imad Wasim run out 0 (2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00']
5.6,"Mohammad Asghar to Vince, 1 run, flat, angling into the pads, clipped to the left of short fine leg",

6.2,"Shahid Afridi to Shoaib Malik, no run, tossed up on a good length outside off, stretches out to push to cover",
6.3,"Shahid Afridi to Shoaib Malik, SIX, sees him coming down the track and looks to bowl it wider and out of Malik's reach, but it's not wide enough for that. Ends up giving him plenty of swinging room and he launches it cleanly over long-off",
6.4,"Shahid Afridi to Shoaib Malik, no run, quicker and closer to off stump, pushed back to the bowler",
6.5,"Shahid Afridi to Shoaib Malik, no run, a bit more air and he stretches out to punch to short cover",
6.6,"Shahid Afridi to Shoaib Malik, no run, short outside off, hurries through to beat the attempted cut",

8.4,"Shahid Afridi to Shakib Al Hasan, no run, quickish, angling across Shakib, who lets it come on to dab to short third man",
8.5,"Shahid Afridi to Shakib Al Hasan, OUT, and he's gone! Again it slants across Shakib, and gets big on Shakib as he looks to whip across the line. May have been a googly too, and he ends up slicing it in the air off the outside edge and short third man takes an excellent low catch diving forward",
8.6,"Shahid Afridi to Bopara, 1 run, fullish outside off, pushed into the cover point region",
9.1,"Mohammad Asghar to Bopara, 1 run, down the track, whips the full ball firmly down the ground, down to long-on",

9.6,"Mohammad Asghar to Vince, 1 run, full on leg stump, clipped away through square leg",

10.2,"Shahid Afridi to Bopara, 3 runs, fullish and wide of off, reaches out to slap it to the left of sweeper cover. Throw to the keeper's end isn't accurate and they take an overthrow",

12.4,"Shahid Afridi to Vince, FOUR, shortish, wide of off, and those nimble hands come into play again as he slaps it away to the cover point boundary",
12.5,"Shahid Afridi to Vince, 1 run, looks to sweep and misses. This one was the slider, no turn, hits his front pad, but it's a long way forward and across the crease, hits him outside the line",
12.6,"Shahid Afridi to Bopara, 1 run, tossed up slow outside off and he's too early into his cover drive, bottom hand comes into play as he drags it down to long-on",

17.4,"Tait to Bopara, 2 runs, yorker on off stump. Looks to make room to drive into the off side and it sneaks away through midwicket off the inside edge. Takes two as deep midwicket runs in, and reaches his half-century",

18.6,"Wahab Riaz to Sohail Tanvir, OUT, yorker, bowled between his legs. What a delivery. Tanvir played across it and lost his leg stump. But the margins are so tiny in this format. That hit the stump and raced to the fine leg boundary. An inch off target and this could have been four byes.",

19.3,"Sammy to Bopara, OUT, full-toss outside off, and Bopara has holed out! He could have hit that to a lot of places on this ground, but he's swiped at it, failed to middle it, and picked out the fielder at long-on",
