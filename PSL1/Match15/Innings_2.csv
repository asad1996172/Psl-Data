0.2,"Ehsan Adil to Tamim Iqbal, 1 run, nicely tucked off his pads to deep square leg",
0.3,"Ehsan Adil to Mohammad Hafeez, no run, ooh, ripper from Adil. Length delivery outside off but lots of away movement. Hafeez is beaten comprehensively",

0.5,"Ehsan Adil to Mohammad Hafeez, no run, full and straight, pushed away to mid-on against the direction of swing",
0.6,"Ehsan Adil to Mohammad Hafeez, no run, goes through. Good length outside off, nowhere near short enough for Hafeez to pull but he goes for it. Beaten",
1.1,"Bravo to Tamim Iqbal, no run, Bravo starts with a very short delivery on middle, Tamim ducks underneath",
1.2,"Bravo to Tamim Iqbal, no run, back of a length outside off, Tamim goes for a short-arm jab but misses. Fails to pick his stroke correctly",
1.3,"Bravo to Tamim Iqbal, FOUR, excellent shot selection there though. Shortish outside off, Tamim stands tall and punches the backfoot drive into the gap at extra cover. Four",
1.4,"Bravo to Tamim Iqbal, 2 runs, off the glove towards fine leg. Interesting decision to come back for the second. Very iffy but the throw isn't particularly great. They make it in the end",

3.1,"Cooper to Mohammad Hafeez, FOUR, hit-me ball is hit away. Short and wide with third man up, Hafeez leans on the cut and finds the gap behind point for four. Very poor stuff",
3.2,"Cooper to Mohammad Hafeez, OUT, what a catch that is. Azhar has pulled off a stunner. Match-changing stuff. Short delivery outside off, Hafeez comes down and looks to swat the ball over mid-of but doesn't get enough of it. It comes off the upper half of the bat and lobs towards mid-off. Azhar runs back and dives to complete a two-handed grab. Stunning",['Mohammad Hafeez c Azhar Ali b Cooper 9 (7b 2x4 0x6) SR: 128.57']

6.4,"Delport to Malan, no run, slower delivery outside off, driven uppishly towards mid-off. Played way too early",

7.2,"Zohaib Khan to Kamran Akmal, 1 run, flat on off, pushed to deep cover by Akmal",
7.3,"Zohaib Khan to Malan, 4 byes, Malan goes for the reverse-sweep. Makes no connection. Goes down leg and the keeper is intent on appealing rather than attempting to stop it. Four byes",

10.2,"Delport to Malan, 1 run, full on off, drilled down to long-off. Pressure building slowly but steadily",
10.3,"Delport to Kamran Akmal, OUT, and there it is. That pressure has caused a big stroke, but a badly timed one. Fullish on leg, Akmal backs away and squirts one in the air. Azhar runs in from deep midwicket and holds onto an easy chance. Momentum shifting towards Lahore",
10.4,"Delport to Malan, 1 run",
10.5,"Delport to Shahid Afridi, 1 run, full on middle, tucked to deep midwicket by Afridi. Hmm",['Kamran Akmal c Azhar Ali b Delport 18 (20b 1x4 0x6) SR: 90.00']

11.4,"Cooper to Malan, 1 run, short and wide again, pushed towards point",
11.5,"Cooper to Shahid Afridi, 2 runs, over short fine leg. Lucky Afridi. Afridi gets down early to play a cheeky ramp. Doesn't get the place on the ball but gets enough to evade the fielder",
11.6,"Cooper to Shahid Afridi, 1 run, pushed into the off side",
12.1,"Delport to Shahid Afridi, FOUR, low full toss, just a flick to the boundary. Wide of long-on, Akmal puts in a drive but can't keep it in. Poor effort, should have done better",
12.2,"Delport to Shahid Afridi, OUT, gone. Afridi goes. Afridi's poor run continues. Length delivery on middle, Delport takes the pace off it and Afridi goes for it again. Skews off the outside half of the bat, and goes straight up. Akmal runs in and settled under it",

14.1,"Bravo to Malan, no run, slower ball outside off, punched to point. Malan comes down for one but is sent back",
14.2,"Bravo to Malan, 1 leg bye, big appeal but that pitched easily down leg. Slower ball misses the flick and strikes Malan on the pad",

15.4,"Ehsan Adil to Shahid Yousuf, 1 run, full on off, whacked to long-on. Just the one",
15.5,"Ehsan Adil to Malan, SIX, big hit, massive from Malan. Slower ball on middle, good change in pace but right in the slot for Malan. Thwacked away high but enough to clear the midwicket boundary with lots of ease",
15.6,"Ehsan Adil to Malan, 1 run, turned with soft hands to deep midwicket for a run",
16.1,"Cooper to Malan, OUT, flat delivery on off on a good length. Played down towards his feet and Yousuf calls for a run. Cooper is very quick on it, picks up and under-arms the throw onto the stumps. He is short. Well short, and Lahore have the breakthrough. Iffy run, despite no hesitation Yousuf was still short.",
16.2,"Cooper to Sammy, no run, beaten outside off.",
16.3,"Cooper to Sammy, no run, another dot. Length delivery keeps very low. Sammy just about gets bat down on it.",

16.5,"Cooper to Sammy, OUT, gone, Sammy is out. Slower delivery outside off, Sammy plays too early and scoops it to cover. The umpires go up to query the bump ball. Yup, out. Straight off the toe end and Lahore have another",['Shahid Yousuf run out 16 (11b 3x4 0x6) SR: 145.45']

17.5,"Bravo to Wahab Riaz, 1 run, in the air and on the bounce to cover. Would have been out with a direct hit as well at the strikers end. The slower ball deceived Riaz",
17.6,"Bravo to Malan, 1 run, gives himself room to guide to deep cover. He'll keep strike.",
18.1,"Cooper to Malan, OUT, it is the former. It is the massive wicket of Malan. What a breakthrough this is. Yorker on leg, swinging into Malan. He misses and is struck on the boot. The umpire raises the finger very quickly, but was that drifting down leg?",

18.6,"Cooper to Junaid Khan, no run, nope, they do not get it. Just two of the over. Length on middle, Junaid can't do much with his swing. Slogs it off the inside half to the keeper and Riaz refuses the run",
19.1,"Ehsan Adil to Wahab Riaz, no run, wow, you won't get a better delivery to hit. Full toss on the pads, Riaz is very late on the flick and is hit on the pad. Dot",['DJ Malan lbw b Cooper 42 (35b 0x4 3x6) SR: 120.00']
19.2,"Ehsan Adil to Wahab Riaz, no run, lovely yorker on middle, jammed back to the bowler who does well to kick it towards cover in his follow-through. Riaz refuses the single",

19.5,"Ehsan Adil to Wahab Riaz, 2 runs, full toss on middle, another hit-me delivery. Riaz smashes it towards long-on and they come back for two. Two poor full-tosses in this over but only two of em.",
