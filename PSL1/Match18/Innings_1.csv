Ball,Commentary,Wicket
0.1,"Anwar Ali to Gayle, FOUR, what a start for Gayle. But he gets a terrible ball, must be said. Low full toss outside off, Gayle drives it in the gap at cover for four. Did not have to do much to get Lahore off and running",
0.2,"Anwar Ali to Gayle, no run, better from Anwar. Full on off, Gayle defends into the cover region. Not a good length when Gayle is teeing off though",
0.3,"Anwar Ali to Gayle, no run, crashed to cover. Phew, that flew. Very full outside off, Gayle creams a drive straight to the fielder",
0.4,"Anwar Ali to Gayle, no run, slower ball on off, that spun. Gayle pats it to the off side",
0.5,"Anwar Ali to Gayle, 1 run, outside edge to third man. Bowls this on a back of a length outside off and Gayle tries to punch through cover",
0.6,"Anwar Ali to Azhar Ali, 1 run, too straight and tucked off his pads to deep square leg to get off the mark",
1.1,"Umar Gul to Azhar Ali, no run, nips back in from a good length to hit Azhar high on the thigh pad. Good start",

1.4,"Umar Gul to Gayle, 2 runs, pierces the gap at extra cover for a brace. Good shot, did not look to hit it too hard. Stayed on the back foot and punched the back of the length delivery",
1.5,"Umar Gul to Gayle, no run, nice from Umar. Full delivery outside off, but Gayle is beaten by a bit of away movement",
1.6,"Umar Gul to Gayle, FOUR, poor ball. Giving Gayle a few freebies to start isn't a very clever idea. Low full toss outside off, Gayle leans on the drive and finds the gap through cover for four. Two free boundaries for Gayle",
2.1,"Anwar Ali to Azhar Ali, 1 run, nice batting. Shuffles across to the back of the length delivery to tuck to backward square leg. Intent was one all along",

2.6,"Anwar Ali to Gayle, no run, good change in length but that hardly surprised Gayle, who I'd suspect was anticipating that after the full stuff. Bouncer outside off, rises steeply and beats the pull of Gayle. Good hustling delivery",
3.1,"Umar Gul to Azhar Ali, 1 run, excellent stuff from Azhar. Guides the dab to third man off the open face. On to you, CG",
3.2,"Umar Gul to Gayle, SIX, oh, my. 1560-metre hit that. Wow. Good length on off, Gayle stays back and clobbers the pull way over the midwicket boundary. Absolutely humongous that. Gayle looking dangerous",
3.3,"Umar Gul to Gayle, no run, not anticipating that length, there. Full on leg, in the slot again. Hits Gayle on the pad and then to short third man.",
3.4,"Umar Gul to Gayle, no run, good delivery that. Bouncer angled away from Gayle who decides to leave. Nice change up",
