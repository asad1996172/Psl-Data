Ball,Commentary,Wicket
0.1,"Anwar Ali to Azhar Ali, no run, perhaps a touch too wide down the other side this time, but Anwar's awayswing was clearly on show. Pitched on a decent length and weaved past the flashing blade",
0.2,"Anwar Ali to Azhar Ali, no run, inswing this time, and it looked good enough for Anwar to go up for an lbw shout. But I suspect there was an inside edge, and the impact was outside off.",
0.3,"Anwar Ali to Azhar Ali, no run, struck on the back pad this time as Anwar is making the ball talk under lights. Azhar was forward and played around his front pad, looking towards midwicket.",
0.4,"Anwar Ali to Azhar Ali, SIX, decides to meet the ball before it swings and whaddya know! Picks it up off a length and mauls it over wide long-on",
0.5,"Anwar Ali to Azhar Ali, no run, walks at the medium pacer, but this time Anwar spotted the movement early and pulled his length back. Added to that is the way he is making the ball hold its line on middle and off. Azhar ends up with a leading edge to point",
0.6,"Anwar Ali to Azhar Ali, 1 run, short and wide outside off, Azhar gave it everything but will have to settle for a single to third man",
1.1,"Mohammad Nabi to Azhar Ali, 1 run, did that carry to square leg? Azhar went for a premeditated sweep and went through with the shot even when the ball was a touch shorter than ideal for the shot. Had to drag it from outside off too. Lucky that it did not reach the fielder on the full, bad bounce means a misfield",
1.2,"Mohammad Nabi to Delport, no run, flighted delivery on off stump, defended",
1.3,"Mohammad Nabi to Delport, no run, stays on the back foot because he is not certain about coming forward, punched into the covers",
1.4,"Mohammad Nabi to Delport, 2 runs, still stuck on the back foot, a little nervous about how far the ball would turn. Understandable considering this is a brand new cherry which is not supposed to grip. Except it does and Delport, who was making room to cut, ends up reaching for it and gets an inside edge through the keeper",
1.5,"Mohammad Nabi to Delport, no run, leaves the flighted delivery outside off",
1.6,"Mohammad Nabi to Delport, 1 run, stays back, waits for the flatter delivery to turn outside off and then flat bats it to long-on",

2.2,"Zulfiqar Babar to Azhar Ali, no run, pushed through on middle, defended",
2.3,"Zulfiqar Babar to Azhar Ali, FOUR, away through midwicket. Lovely pick up. Babar dropped it short and Azhar made it worse by jumping back and using the depth of the crease.",
2.4,"Zulfiqar Babar to Azhar Ali, 1 run, flighted just outside off, Azhar looks to defend and gets an inside edge towards square leg",
2.5,"Zulfiqar Babar to Delport, no run, opts for the reverse sweep, but jumped the gun too early. Zulfiqar slips in the quicker ball outisde leg to make sure he foils Delport's intentions",
2.6,"Zulfiqar Babar to Delport, 1 run, clipped into the leg side and orthodoxy gets runs. Who would have known?",
3.1,"Anwar Ali to Delport, no run, short of a good length on off stump, forced into the covers. Playing with such hard hands is Delport. Itching to get a few boundaries",
3.2,"Anwar Ali to Delport, no run, oooh, here we go. Delport plants the front leg across and looks for the agricultural heave over midwicket. Misses the slower ball",
3.3,"Anwar Ali to Delport, no run, back of a length and outside off, Delport moves inside the line to try and punch through the covers. Misses",
3.4,"Anwar Ali to Delport, no run, pushed across the left-hander, swish and miss",

4.1,"Mohammad Nawaz to Delport, no run, backs away, when he should have eased forward. That means its a panicked slash that comes out. No run to point",
4.2,"Mohammad Nawaz to Delport, FOUR, that's more like it. Finally spots the real estate behind the bowler and plants his flag there. Runs down at the left-arm spinner, hits with the turn and belts it down the ground",
4.3,"Mohammad Nawaz to Delport, no run, fired in quick and outside off, Delport looks for the square drive. No connection",
4.4,"Mohammad Nawaz to Delport, 1 run, goes back to the flatter ball on off stump and flicks to long-on",
4.5,"Mohammad Nawaz to Azhar Ali, FOUR, just over point! The fielder did the best he could, propelling himself to his right, but Azhar's cut had just enough power to beat him. Good shot. Made room for himself and took it off the stumps",
4.6,"Mohammad Nawaz to Azhar Ali, no run, leans forward, but gets too close to the ball on middle. Ends up popping it down the pitch to the bowler",
5.1,"Mohammad Nabi to Delport, no run, short and outside off, Delport timed the pants off it, but does not find the gap at cover",
5.2,"Mohammad Nabi to Delport, FOUR, oooh, inside edge and the deflection manages to evade the stumps and the keeper and wander off to the long leg boundary. Delport ran down the track, didn't get to the pitch and went for the slog",
5.3,"Mohammad Nabi to Delport, no run, tossed up wide outside off, and yet he goes for the drag into midwicket. Beaten soundly",
5.4,"Mohammad Nabi to Delport, 1 run, flatter ball whipped away to deep midwicket",
5.5,"Mohammad Nabi to Azhar Ali, no run, that, I suspect, was a missed stumping. Sarfraz has not stayed down low enough to get to this quicker, fuller ball outside off that has completely foxed Azhar. Nabi has done well to create the opportunity, after being put under pressure by the advancing batsman.",
5.6,"Mohammad Nabi to Azhar Ali, no run",
6.1,"Zulfiqar Babar to Delport, FOUR, picked up the perfect ball for the reverse sweep. It is length, it was drifting onto off stump and those powerful wrists sent it galloping away to the third man boundary",
6.2,"Zulfiqar Babar to Delport, no run, some turn off middle and leg, Delport clips it to midwicket",
6.3,"Zulfiqar Babar to Delport, no run, tossed up on middle, Delport blocks it back at the bowler. Lovely lines from Zulfiqar",
6.4,"Zulfiqar Babar to Delport, 1 run, half an lbw appeal as Delport goes for a sweep to a good length ball on middle stump. Bat involved there",
6.5,"Zulfiqar Babar to Azhar Ali, 1 run, beaten in the flight and the leading edge does not reach as far as it needs to. Azhar was lunging forward for a lash through cover, but Zulfiqar makes it dip before he can reach it. Beautiful to watch.",
6.6,"Zulfiqar Babar to Delport, 1 run, flatter ball on leg stump, clipped behind square leg",
7.1,"Umar Gul to Delport, no run, back of a length on off stump, pushed to mid-off",
7.2,"Umar Gul to Delport, no run, goes short on middle, Delport mistimes a pull on the back foot to midwicket",

7.5,"Umar Gul to Azhar Ali, 1 run, another short ball that follows the right-hander down the leg side, but Azhar manages to whack it away to deep square leg. As much instinct as intention",
7.6,"Umar Gul to Delport, 1 run, moves away to leg side, Gul follows him with a shortish delivery, worked for a single to midwicket",
8.1,"Mohammad Nawaz to Delport, no run, tossed up on off stump, driven to the left of the bowler",
8.2,"Mohammad Nawaz to Delport, 1 run, jumps around for the reverse flick, but Nawaz does well to slip in the quicker, zippy arm ball. Only a single to square leg",
8.3,"Mohammad Nawaz to Azhar Ali, no run, moves leg side to drive the good length ball on the stumps to cover",
8.4,"Mohammad Nawaz to Azhar Ali, 1 run, that's lovely batting. Realised the ball was full on leg stump and sweeps away. Great connection but there is protection in the deep at fine leg",
8.5,"Mohammad Nawaz to Delport, SIX, beautifully done! He timed his move down the pitch perfectly, so much that Nawaz could not adjust his length as he did before. Tossed it up to be walloped back over long-on",
8.6,"Mohammad Nawaz to Delport, 1 run, predictably this is quick and flat, Delport hammers it down to long-off. Scary power from the left-hander",
9.1,"Umar Gul to Delport, no run, full on middle, squeezed into the extra cover region",
9.2,"Umar Gul to Delport, FOUR, belted to the midwicket boundary. I am not sure about the wisdom of bowling Gul at this time of the innings. Pace on the ball is working to Delport's advantage and no matter how much they try, this pitch won't let the short balls zip though. It's slow, it sits up and it will be crashed away",
9.3,"Umar Gul to Delport, no run, full and angled across the left-hander, Delport swings blindly across the line and is beaten",
9.4,"Umar Gul to Delport, 1 run, fearsome yorker curling in on leg stump, Delport does really well to put his feet out of the way and get his bat down on it. Quick single to mid-off despite the direct hit",
9.5,"Umar Gul to Azhar Ali, no run, back of a length ball outside off has been smacked to mid-off",
9.6,"Umar Gul to Azhar Ali, OUT, and the short ball has worked, for the very reason it probably should not. Held in the pitch to ruin Azhar's timing. He was backing away to play the upper cut, but made the move to do so too early. So ends up having to wait while he was losing balance. No timing on the shot, but it does have enough height to sail down third man's throat",['Azhar Ali c Akbar-ur-Rehman b Umar Gul 20 (21b 2x4 1x6) SR: 95.23']
10.1,"Zulfiqar Babar to Umar Akmal, no run, was there an edge? Babar loops it up on off stump, dips on the batsman before he could reach it. Akmal was closing his bat face too, makes him look worse when the ball zips across and into the keeper's gloves. Babar is in much anguish, does he think Akmal hit that?",
10.2,"Zulfiqar Babar to Umar Akmal, 1 run, driven through to long-off to get off the mark",
10.3,"Zulfiqar Babar to Delport, FOUR, looks for a six over long-on, but ends up dragging the ball to the midwicket boundary because Babar beat him in flight even as he was charging down the pitch.",
10.4,"Zulfiqar Babar to Delport, FOUR, eish. That's a full toss which is muscled, as it deserved to be, over cow corner",
10.5,"Zulfiqar Babar to Delport, 1 run, gets down the track, but can't reach the pitch because of Babar's control and dip, inside edge to deep midwicket gets him his half-century. Credit to him for sticking around and not letting his early nerves get the better on him",
10.6,"Zulfiqar Babar to Umar Akmal, no run, attempts to play around his front pad with a closed face again. This good length ball pitches on off stump and goes on with the arm. For the second time in the over Zulfiqar is certain he has dismissed Akmal, goes up for several shouts for lbw, but is denied every time. HawkEye shows it should not have been. Hitting in line, crashing leg stump",
11.1,"Mohammad Nabi to Delport, no run, pushed through on middle and leg, defended",
11.2,"Mohammad Nabi to Delport, SIX, races down the track and launches Nabi over long-off. He's gotten set now, and the anxiousness he had early on against spin is not there anymore",

11.4,"Mohammad Nabi to Delport, 1 run, fired in on leg stump, squirted behind square leg",
11.5,"Mohammad Nabi to Umar Akmal, 1 run, shortish and outside off, dabbed through point",
11.6,"Mohammad Nabi to Delport, 2 runs, moves leg side of this one and gets the room he wants to shovel an almost yorker on off stump through extra cover",
12.1,"Mohammad Nawaz to Umar Akmal, FOUR, terrible ball, dragged it down and Akmal rocks back to lash it over midwicket.",
12.2,"Mohammad Nawaz to Umar Akmal, 2 runs, shimmies down and laces it through extra cover. Delport has done magnificently to turn a single into a two",
12.3,"Mohammad Nawaz to Umar Akmal, 1 run, nudged through midwicket",
12.4,"Mohammad Nawaz to Delport, 1 run, fired down leg because now the spinner is fearing Delport's hitting ability. Leg bye to long leg",
12.5,"Mohammad Nawaz to Umar Akmal, FOUR, what more can a bowler do? He beats the batsman in flight, gets the edge and yet goes for a boundary. Akmal was dancing down, the left-armer sent down a dart on middle. Seemed set to topple the stumps until the flashing blade",
12.6,"Mohammad Nawaz to Umar Akmal, 1 run, worked behind square leg",
13.1,"Umar Gul to Umar Akmal, SIX, swatted down the ground. It wasn't the idea length for the front foot lash - shortish - but it had enough room for Akmal to ignore the coaching manual.",
13.2,"Umar Gul to Umar Akmal, 2 runs, full and tailing in on middle, heaved away through mdwicket for a couple. Lovely running to go with the hitting",
13.3,"Umar Gul to Umar Akmal, SIX, overpitched and in the slot, that time the coaching manual would be proud. Thumped down the ground, where it deserved to be put.",
13.4,"Umar Gul to Umar Akmal, 1 run, rapid short ball outside off, Akmal goes for the pull but he is rushed because of the extra heat on this ball. Gets it on the splice as the ball pops up and lands safely at mid-on",
13.5,"Umar Gul to Delport, 1 run, full and outside off, driven on the up to long-off",
13.6,"Umar Gul to Umar Akmal, 1 run, goes full and on leg stump, Akmal pushes it to long-off",
14.1,"Akbar-ur-Rehman to Umar Akmal, no run, tossed up outside off, smeared to extra cover",

14.4,"Akbar-ur-Rehman to Delport, 1 run, flatter ball on middle, carved to long-on. Fumble down there as the pressure continues to get the better of Quetta",
14.5,"Akbar-ur-Rehman to Umar Akmal, SIX, another awful ball from the legspinner. Dragged it terribly short and Akmal has hit a bigger one over cow corner.",
14.6,"Akbar-ur-Rehman to Umar Akmal, FOUR, keeps bowling short, keeps getting thumped. This time its quicker and wider outside off and Akmal uses all the pace with a beautiful cut shot.",
15.1,"Mohammad Nabi to Delport, 1 run, fired in on leg stump, driven to long-on",
15.2,"Mohammad Nabi to Umar Akmal, no run, loops it up and lands it in the blockhole. All Akmal can do is protect his stumps",
15.3,"Mohammad Nabi to Umar Akmal, SIX, that time the yorker becomes a low full toss and Akmal has pings the sightscreen. Watches it fly, then pulls off his helmet, calls the attention for someone in the crowd and sends a flying kiss.",
15.4,"Mohammad Nabi to Umar Akmal, 1 run, flatter delivery outside off, cut through point",
15.5,"Mohammad Nabi to Delport, no run, ooooh, pounded back at the bowler straight at his face, Nabi pulls his hand up just in time and saves his features. No way was he going to catch that. Delport offers an apology immediately.",
15.6,"Mohammad Nabi to Delport, SIX, another out outta the park! Nabi pitches it in the slot on leg stump and is hoisted down the ground. This plan of hitting the straight boundary is seamless, simple and often effective",
16.1,"Zulfiqar Babar to Umar Akmal, SIX, the spinners aren't learning their lessons and Akmal is quite content to keep depositing them into the stands beyond square leg. Too short. Too short. Too short",
16.2,"Zulfiqar Babar to Umar Akmal, no run, flighted outside off, drilled into the extra cover region",
16.3,"Zulfiqar Babar to Umar Akmal, no run, fired in full on off stump, driven back at the Babar, who vents his frustration with a throw to the keeper. Remember, he had a plumb lbw off Akmal go against his way",

16.5,"Zulfiqar Babar to Delport, no run, tossed up on leg stump, clipped to midwicket",
16.6,"Zulfiqar Babar to Delport, OUT, right in front. Goes for the extravagant reverse flick, which is an odd choice of shot when Babar is firing them in on middle. Ends up not even able to get down on one knee to get the leverage he wants because it is such a quick ball. All he had time for was to switch his stance, and while still upright, he is hit on the toe right in front of middle stump",
17.1,"Anwar Ali to Umar Akmal, 1 run, pushed down the ground quite serenely",['CS Delport lbw b Zulfiqar Babar 73 (55b 8x4 3x6) SR: 132.72']
17.2,"Anwar Ali to Bravo, 1 run, sweetly timed drive to long-off. That lovely whirling bat of Bravo came down so hard on the fuller ball outside off",
17.3,"Anwar Ali to Umar Akmal, FOUR, how about that for a symbol of his form? He has picked up the slower ball early, waits for it on off stump and pumps it behind square leg. The man in the deep only had to move a few paces, but he can't get there in time",
17.4,"Anwar Ali to Umar Akmal, 1 run, ""two, two, two"" they call after Akmal pushes down to long-on. No such luck",
17.5,"Anwar Ali to Bravo, 1 run, falls just short of short third man. Bravo was running away outside leg, Anwar follows him with a slower bouncer, Bravo tries an upper cut and the scampering Chigumbura can't get under it in time",

18.1,"Umar Gul to Umar Akmal, 1 run, drilled through extra cover, all along the ground for a single",
18.2,"Umar Gul to Bravo, 1 run, laced through to the sweeper cover, Bravo watched the ball as closely as he could and sliced it off the base of his stumps",
18.3,"Umar Gul to Umar Akmal, SIX, every bad ball that has come his way has gone for six, this one over midwicket. This innings may have been enabled by full tosses, like this one, and short balls, but Akmal's ability to put them away has truly been breathtaking.",
18.4,"Umar Gul to Umar Akmal, FOUR, overpitched on off, while looking for the yorker, drummed down the ground. Powerful. Too powerful",
18.5,"Umar Gul to Umar Akmal, SIX, its the slower short ball, but with Akmal setting himself up on the back foot, its a treat. Slugged away over long leg. That's his eighth six of the match",
18.6,"Umar Gul to Umar Akmal, 1 run, finds the yorker from around the stumps, and even in this form, Akmal can only push it through to wide long-on",
19.1,"Anwar Ali to Umar Akmal, FOUR, misses the blockhole and when that happens against Akmal in this form, it disappears. Whipped to the wide long-on boundary. Just a couple of bounces. Imagine the bottom-hand strength it takes for that.",
19.2,"Anwar Ali to Umar Akmal, 1 run, full toss on leg stump gets a top edge as Akmal slogs. The fielder at deep square leg runs up, but never looked like getting under it. Akbar there, could have been a catch",

19.4,"Anwar Ali to Umar Akmal, 2 runs, slower short ball and Akmal gets inside the line and pulls it towards the fine leg boundary. Babar is the man running around and flicks it back inside the field of play",
19.5,"Anwar Ali to Umar Akmal, OUT, has he got it? has he cleared the ground again? He has been muscling those short balls away all night, but this time he has picked out the fielder at deep square leg. Certainly made the most of the buffet.",
19.6,"Anwar Ali to Bravo, 1 run, finds the yorker, and he does so after following Bravo who was moving down leg. Single through square leg",
