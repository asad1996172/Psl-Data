0.1,"Bravo to Wright, no run, back of a length on off stump, defended to point",
0.2,"Bravo to Wright, 1 run, driven to mid-on to get off the mark",
0.3,"Bravo to Ahmed Shehzad, no run, figures out the offcutter late, but manages to glide it to short third man",
0.4,"Bravo to Ahmed Shehzad, FOUR, loopy slower ball outside off, Shehzad was waiting to heave it through midwicket, but the ball dips on him! Secures the inside edge and skips past the wicketkeeper",
0.5,"Bravo to Ahmed Shehzad, 1 run, another offcutter, which is more ably slotted through midwicket",
0.6,"Bravo to Wright, no run, beautiful way to end the over, a rare full pace delivery from Bravo, pitching full, lulling the batsman into the drive and curling away past the outside edge",
1.1,"Zafar Gohar to Ahmed Shehzad, 1 run, admirable flight to start off and Shehzad presses forward with a fluent drive through extra cover",
1.2,"Zafar Gohar to Wright, no run, jumps back against a short ball and punches it through point, or so he thought until the fielder puts in a good effort.",
1.3,"Zafar Gohar to Wright, no run, juggles once, juggles twice and then watches the ball drop onto the turf! Gohar's put down a dolly! It was a short ball, so Wright went back to clobber it over midwicket. Except for some reason in this innings, the ball holds up on the pitch and comes off very very slow. Leading edge comes straight at the bowler. I don't think he expected that.",
1.4,"Zafar Gohar to Wright, 1 run, flighted ball outside off, driven to mid-off",
1.5,"Zafar Gohar to Ahmed Shehzad, no run, short and wide, mis-hit back at the bowler",
1.6,"Zafar Gohar to Ahmed Shehzad, 1 run, flatter delivery outside off, cut to extra cover",
2.1,"Cooper to Ahmed Shehzad, no run, full and outside off, squeezed to point",
2.2,"Cooper to Ahmed Shehzad, no run, short and wide outside off, Shehzad made an exaggerated move back and across, prompted to bowler into changing his pace and it works. Batsman slashes and misses",
2.3,"Cooper to Ahmed Shehzad, FOUR, full and on middle and leg, swiped away over wide long-on",
2.4,"Cooper to Ahmed Shehzad, FOUR, too straight again and Shehzad makes that little move inside the line of the ball and clips it to the long leg boundary. Clever shot",
2.5,"Cooper to Ahmed Shehzad, OUT, plants that back leg outside off, showing his cards early, so Cooper looks for the blockhole. It was up the the batsman to adjust, but he doesn't Swings blindly, gets an inside edge and his stumps are a mess",['Ahmed Shehzad b Cooper 15 (11b 3x4 0x6) SR: 136.36']
2.6,"Cooper to Pietersen, FOUR, that's how you get going in a chase that asks you for 10 runs per over. Walk down the track at the fast bowler and whip him over midwicket. KP announces himself.",
3.1,"Zafar Gohar to Wright, 2 runs, comes down the track and launches a length ball down the ground, hit off the bottom of the bat",
3.2,"Zafar Gohar to Wright, OUT, straight down the throat of Cooper, and Gohar has his redemption. Dropped Wright in the last over, now he has him slogging to the fielder at deep midwicket",
3.3,"Zafar Gohar to Mohammad Nawaz, no run, loads of spin now. Rips in at the left-hander who had moved back in his crease to try and flick. If you bowl quick, it spits up.",['LJ Wright c Cooper b Zafar Gohar 4 (8b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50.00']
3.4,"Zafar Gohar to Mohammad Nawaz, no run, another flat and fast delivery, turning into the left-hander. Struck on the pads",
3.5,"Zafar Gohar to Mohammad Nawaz, no run, moves leg side of the dart on off stump and slices it to point",
3.6,"Zafar Gohar to Mohammad Nawaz, 1 run, goes for the pull, but ends up with a top edge because this time he was into the shot too early, unlike the last two balls when the quick turn beat him for pace. Luckily the ball shot straight up and over the wicketkeeper.",
4.1,"Zohaib Khan to Mohammad Nawaz, no run, pushed through on middle and off, defended",
4.2,"Zohaib Khan to Mohammad Nawaz, no run, ooh, Rizwan has missed a stumping there, I think. Ran down the pitch, ends up yorking himself. Wickekeeper wasn't expecting it to come to him because it went straight in and came straight out",
4.3,"Zohaib Khan to Mohammad Nawaz, 1 run, goes back and plays a late cut to short third man",
4.4,"Zohaib Khan to Pietersen, SIX, launched down the ground! Two balls faced, two balls smashed! Picks up a length ball, turning past him outside off, reached that little bit extra because he can and then tonks it down the ground",
4.5,"Zohaib Khan to Pietersen, no run, fired down leg, KP plays a flick and is hit on the pads. Would have missed the stumps easily",
4.6,"Zohaib Khan to Pietersen, 1 run, pulls his length back, so KP defends it into the covers and gets a single. Lovely batting in T20s, not wasting too many balls.",
5.1,"Bravo to Pietersen, 1 run, takes the slower short ball in his stride and pulls to deep square leg",
5.2,"Bravo to Mohammad Nawaz, 1 run, slower ball, pushed full on leg stump, Nawaz turns it into the midwicket region and could well have been run out looking for a quick single",
5.3,"Bravo to Pietersen, no run, banged in short and it zooms over the ducking KP",
5.4,"Bravo to Pietersen, OUT, moves outside leg and slogs at a back of a length ball cramping him up for room. It's a top edge, it's a skier, it's going to be a touch one, but Kevon Cooper is safe as houses. Takes it coolly and sets off on a lap of honour",
5.5,"Bravo to Mohammad Nawaz, 1 run, shortish on off stump, dabbed into the covers for a single",
5.6,"Bravo to Sarfraz Ahmed, FOUR, banged in short and straying too straight, Safraz simply helps it on its way to the long leg boundary",['KP Pietersen c Cooper b Bravo 12 (7b 1x4 1x6) SR: 171.42']
6.1,"Zohaib Khan to Mohammad Nawaz, 1 run, tossed up but drifting down leg, turned to deep square leg",
6.2,"Zohaib Khan to Sarfraz Ahmed, 1 run, adjusts to Sarfraz moving outside leg and follows him. Driven to long-off",
6.3,"Zohaib Khan to Mohammad Nawaz, no run, lands a yorker on leg stump and Nawaz swallows up another dot. Five off 10 now",
6.4,"Zohaib Khan to Mohammad Nawaz, 1 run, short and on off stump, cut to deep cover",
6.5,"Zohaib Khan to Sarfraz Ahmed, SIX, takes it on the full and sweeps it over square leg. Top shot from Sarfraz, quick hands and good intent. But again, the boundary was given away to the batsman rather than earned",
6.6,"Zohaib Khan to Sarfraz Ahmed, no run, the wicketkeeper is absolutely certain of the stumping! Beautiful bowling first up, tossed it high and got it to dip on the batsman which is why Sarfraz is beaten on the sweep shot. He had dragged his back foot outside his crease quite a distance, but was able to make his ground. Rizwan took the ball a little too far back and in the time it took for him to push at the stumps, Sarfraz made it",
7.1,"Hammad Azam to Mohammad Nawaz, 1 run, back of a length and outside of, steered to deep third man",
7.2,"Hammad Azam to Sarfraz Ahmed, no run, back of a length on off stump, pushed into the covers",
7.3,"Hammad Azam to Sarfraz Ahmed, 1 run, lands a yorker on leg stump, bunted into the covers",
7.4,"Hammad Azam to Mohammad Nawaz, 2 runs, takes the length ball and smokes it to the left of long-on, Akmal's the man there, running around and protecting the boundary",
7.5,"Hammad Azam to Mohammad Nawaz, 1 run, hits the yorker on middle, squeezed behind point",
7.6,"Hammad Azam to Sarfraz Ahmed, 1 run, fuller ball outside off, slower too, smeared to sweeper cover",
8.1,"Mendis to Sarfraz Ahmed, 1 run, starts with a legspinner, which Sarfraz did not pick. Set up for the pull shot over cow corner, ends up patting the ball through mid-on instead",
8.2,"Mendis to Mohammad Nawaz, no run, comes down the track and belts a flighted ball back at Mendis",
8.3,"Mendis to Mohammad Nawaz, FOUR, that's the wrong 'un and Nawaz has picked it. Makes room outside off and clatters the ball over cover. That boundary was made from how early he read the change up",
8.4,"Mendis to Mohammad Nawaz, 3 byes, and now he should have been out for a rush of blood. Rizwan misses a stumping. Goes out the front of the hand, grips and turns into the left-hander who slogs when there is no room. Goes through bat and pad and the wicketkeeper fluffs it",
8.5,"Mendis to Sarfraz Ahmed, FOUR, puts away the quicker, length ball. Vicious sweep shot from the Quetta captain",
8.6,"Mendis to Sarfraz Ahmed, no run, pushed through outside off, Sarfraz is unable to reach it with a cut",
9.1,"Hammad Azam to Mohammad Nawaz, FOUR, one-bounce to the square leg boundary. Saw the slower ball early and takes full toll of it being short of a length as well. Hits on he up and swings it off his hips",
9.2,"Hammad Azam to Mohammad Nawaz, FOUR, spectacular batting. Three men in the deep are on the leg side so not too much traffic on the point boundary. Yorker goes wrong and Nawaz punishes the overpitched ball",
9.3,"Hammad Azam to Mohammad Nawaz, 1 leg bye, looks for the pull, but this time he is beaten for pace. Sarfraz though has spotted the chance for a quick single",
9.4,"Hammad Azam to Sarfraz Ahmed, 1 run, shortish delivery outside off, slapped to deep point",
9.5,"Hammad Azam to Mohammad Nawaz, FOUR, full toss outside off at a sedate pace, essentially asking Nawaz to dig in, and so he does. Slapped through extra cover",
9.6,"Hammad Azam to Mohammad Nawaz, SIX, brilliant awareness of the field. Cover went back, fine leg came up and he's swept a six over fine leg. Appears he likes Azam's medium pace. Had no fear in going down on one knee and lifting this length ball from off stump",
10.1,"Zohaib Khan to Sarfraz Ahmed, 2 runs, doesn't stop the Quetta captain from doing the same again. Moves outside off, clears the front leg to smear the flighted ball outside off towards the wide long-on boundary. Akmal with a dive saves two",
10.2,"Zohaib Khan to Sarfraz Ahmed, 2 runs, tossed up outside off, Sarfraz drives fluently through the covers",
10.3,"Zohaib Khan to Sarfraz Ahmed, 2 runs, wanderes outside off, Zohaib has to go further outside off and slices to point. Run out chance at the non-strikers' turns out as an overthrow because Zohaib couldn't collect the ball cleanly",
10.4,"Zohaib Khan to Sarfraz Ahmed, no run, goes for the slog sweep, but misses because Zohaib gets this tossed up ball to dip below his bat",
10.5,"Zohaib Khan to Sarfraz Ahmed, 2 runs, threaded through the coveres",
10.6,"Zohaib Khan to Sarfraz Ahmed, no run, plants himself outside off to try and flick the full ball outside off through midwicket. Gets a leading edge",
11.1,"Cooper to Mohammad Nawaz, no run, zips a good length ball past the outside edge of Nawaz's bat as he was looking for a dab to third man",
11.2,"Cooper to Mohammad Nawaz, no run, another attempted glide to third man ruined because Cooper's short of a good length ball bounces over the top edge",
11.3,"Cooper to Mohammad Nawaz, 2 runs, so Nawaz goes for the no-frills slap through the covers. Length ball outside off becomes a couple of runs. Great running from Sarfraz",
11.4,"Cooper to Mohammad Nawaz, FOUR, great placement! He has been looking for third man, and now he slots the ball to that boundary. What's more, that was almost a yorker and yet Nawaz split the two fielders there",
11.5,"Cooper to Mohammad Nawaz, 1 leg bye, keeps looking to be cheeky and keeps coming up short. This time he moves across to look for a scoop, but Cooper's offcutter grips a bit more and hits the body. Sarfraz pulls him for a single",
11.6,"Cooper to Sarfraz Ahmed, FOUR, ready, set, length ball, smashed over midwicket. Took that back leg outside off, cleared the front one and simply flogged a relatively good length ball outside off",
12.1,"Zohaib Khan to Mohammad Nawaz, 2 runs, follows the left-hander moving outside leg, hits the blockhole too, and yet Quetta take a couple! This is a spectacular partnership and Sarfraz is so quick. He was already coming back by the time Nawaz had touched down on the non-stirkers' end",
12.2,"Zohaib Khan to Mohammad Nawaz, 1 run, good length ball outside off, defended into the off side",
12.3,"Zohaib Khan to Sarfraz Ahmed, OUT, beautifully done! Zohaib has duped the dangerous Sarfraz and he loves it. Spreads his hands and borrows Shoaib Akhtar's aeroplane celebration. Almost on instinct he slid this flatter ball wide outside off, and his instinct proved right because Sarfraz was hurtling down the track. This time Rizwan behind the stumps does perfectly, taking the ball and whipping the bails off",
12.4,"Zohaib Khan to Mohammad Nabi, 1 run, tossed up outside off, eased into third man territory",
12.5,"Zohaib Khan to Mohammad Nawaz, 1 run, drilled to the right of long-off and with Sarfraz gone, that's only a single",['Sarfraz Ahmed st †Mohammad Rizwan b Zohaib Khan 31 (19b 3x4 1x6) SR: 163.15']
12.6,"Zohaib Khan to Mohammad Nabi, 1 run, low full toss outside off, slashed to point. Should have made more than that",
13.1,"Mendis to Mohammad Nabi, 1 run, long hop outside off, but Nabi has hit it straight to the sweeper",
13.2,"Mendis to Mohammad Nawaz, no run, fired in quicker, and on a full length and outside off. Everything foils the suddenly under pressure Nawaz who goes for a slog sweep. Probably the worst shot for that ball",
13.3,"Mendis to Mohammad Nawaz, 1 leg bye, another flatter delivery on middle and leg, Nawaz goes for another awful slog and is hit on the thigh",
13.4,"Mendis to Mohammad Nabi, 1 run, follows Nabi who was making room and keeps it to a single to long-on",
13.5,"Mendis to Mohammad Nawaz, OUT, another stumping for Rizwan, rapidly making up for his misses earlier. Nawaz runs down the track and plays across the line of a ball angled across him. Nowhere near the line of the ball and perishes. Some stunning strokes in the innings, but he succumbs to scoreboard pressure here.",
13.6,"Mendis to Chigumbura, 1 run, good length ball turning away from the right-hander, outside edge to cover",
14.1,"Zafar Gohar to Chigumbura, 1 run, tossed up outside off, chipped to long-off",
14.2,"Zafar Gohar to Mohammad Nabi, 2 runs, advances and drills a flighted delivery through the covers.",
14.3,"Zafar Gohar to Mohammad Nabi, OUT, he has done him in flight! There is something special in an orthodox spin bowler trumping a big-hitting batsman by giving the ball that little bit of air. Here Nabi had opened his shoulders, going down town. Except Gohar got the ball a little wide of his reach, and it had dipped on him as well. The connection is at the very bottom of the bat and long-on runs around to take the catch",['Mohammad Nawaz (3) st †Mohammad Rizwan b Mendis 42 (34b 5x4 1x6) SR: 123.52']
14.4,"Zafar Gohar to Chigumbura, 1 run, that time its flatter and he drive through the covers",
14.5,"Zafar Gohar to Akbar-ur-Rehman, no run, opens the face and drives at cover",
14.6,"Zafar Gohar to Akbar-ur-Rehman, 1 run, pushed through down leg, swept to short fine leg",
15.1,"Mendis to Akbar-ur-Rehman, 1 run, shortish and outside off, cut to backward point",
15.2,"Mendis to Chigumbura, OUT, straight to point. This was flighted on off stump, Chigumbura went after it as hard as he could, but it's a total mis-hit",['Mohammad Nabi c Umar Akmal b Zafar Gohar 6 (6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 100.00']
15.3,"Mendis to Anwar Ali, 2 runs, punched into the covers for a couple of runs as the man running in from the boundary misfields",
15.4,"Mendis to Anwar Ali, 1 run, another short ball outside off patted to long-off",
15.5,"Mendis to Akbar-ur-Rehman, 1 run, good length on off stump, pushed through the covers off the back foot",
15.6,"Mendis to Anwar Ali, OUT, simply done. Anwar panics and runs at Mendis and swings all around a legcutter it seemed like. Gets a leading edge that point hunts down",
16.1,"Zafar Gohar to Zulfiqar Babar, 1 run, defends a good length ball into the covers for a single",['E Chigumbura c Azhar Ali b Mendis 3 (4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 75.00']
16.2,"Zafar Gohar to Umar Gul, OUT, length ball, wide outside off, slogged straight to Umar Akmal at long-on. It has been his day through and through",
