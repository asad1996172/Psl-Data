0.1,"Mohammad Asghar to Roy, no run, fires this flat on middle from around the stumps, punched to cover",
0.2,"Mohammad Asghar to Roy, FOUR, gives him the charge! Steps out, gets underneath the flight and lofts him over mid-on. Crisp hit",
0.3,"Mohammad Asghar to Roy, 1 run, drifting into middle and leg, worked to mid-on for a quick single",
0.4,"Mohammad Asghar to McCullum, no run, gets back into the crease and defends to the leg side",
0.5,"Mohammad Asghar to McCullum, no run, shaped to sweep but changed his stroke in the end, dabbed to the off side",
0.6,"Mohammad Asghar to McCullum, OUT, see you later, Baz. The plan of starting with left-arm spin, which McCullum said was a challenge at the toss, has worked. Looks to pull, but this wasn't all that short, and so he couldn't get much power on the stroke and Malan took the simplest of catches at deep midwicket.",['BB McCullum c Malan b Mohammad Asghar 0 (3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00']
1.1,"Hasan Ali to Roy, FOUR, walks across the stumps and flicks the leg-stump half-volley to the fine leg boundary. Easy pickings",
1.2,"Hasan Ali to Roy, no run, full-length delivery outside off, thumped to mid-off. Looked to go over",
1.3,"Hasan Ali to Roy, OUT, another one bites the dust. Yesterday's half-centurion is gone. Steps out to go over mid-off but hits it flat to Jordan there. He times his jump well to complete a straightforward catch. Trouble for Lahore, joy for Hasan Ali.",
1.4,"Hasan Ali to Umar Akmal, no run, beauty! Nips away late to beat him on a forward push",['JJ Roy c Jordan b Hasan Ali 9 (6b 2x4 0x6) SR: 150.00']
1.5,"Hasan Ali to Umar Akmal, no run, gets on top of the bounce and punches the short of length delivery to point",
1.6,"Hasan Ali to Umar Akmal, OUT, what is happening there? Let's get a selfie says skipper Sammy. This is an outstanding catch by Hafeez at second slip. Umar Akmal chases a wide delivery, but can only manage a thick edge. The ball flew, make no mistake, and Hafeez moved swiftly to his left to complete a tumbling catch. Second duck in three innings for Umar Akmal",
2.1,"Mohammad Hafeez to Fakhar Zaman, FOUR, wickets have fallen, so what? Zaman steps out and whips him into the midwicket boundary.",
2.2,"Mohammad Hafeez to Fakhar Zaman, no run, gets forward and bunts the in-drifter to the off side",['Umar Akmal c Mohammad Hafeez b Hasan Ali 0 (3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00']
2.3,"Mohammad Hafeez to Fakhar Zaman, SIX, biffed into the wide long-on boundary. That sounded really sweet as he made contact. Advanced down the track and met the ball on the half-volley. Power of his swing did the rest. Long, long way back into the stands",
2.4,"Mohammad Hafeez to Fakhar Zaman, 1 run, worked with the angle to long-on as they jog the single",
2.5,"Mohammad Hafeez to Elliott, no run, nearly a leading edge back to Hafeez. Looks to work it with the spin to the leg side",
2.6,"Mohammad Hafeez to Elliott, no run, steps out and turns it with the spin to short midwicket this time",
3.1,"Hasan Ali to Fakhar Zaman, FOUR, full and angling away, he gets forward and thrashes this into the gap at cover.",
3.2,"Hasan Ali to Fakhar Zaman, 3 runs, swung away to the leg side, Jordan from mid-on hares across to pull that back in near the deep midwicket boundary",
3.3,"Hasan Ali to Elliott, OUT, what was all the fuss about? We saw a decision yesterday too, where Sanga wasn't sure if he took it cleanly, but was given out. Sammy wasn't sure if his fingers were completely underneath the ball, but it turns out that he actually has taken it cleanly. Back of a length delivery that jags away from off stump, Elliott hangs his bat out and gets a thick edge into Sammy's bucket hands at slip.",
3.4,"Hasan Ali to Mohammad Rizwan, no run, he's moving it both ways. This one comes back in from outside off, Rizwan shoulders arms",
3.5,"Hasan Ali to Mohammad Rizwan, no run, there's some fizz on this length ball outside off, the probing length again, he shoulders arms",
3.6,"Hasan Ali to Mohammad Rizwan, no run, moves away off the seam from outside off again, left alone. Cracking over",['GD Elliott c Sammy b Hasan Ali 0 (3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00']
4.1,"Jordan to Fakhar Zaman, 2 runs, whips a length ball on the pads to the deep midwicket region",
4.2,"Jordan to Fakhar Zaman, no run, not much room this time, bunts the away-going length ball to the off side",
4.3,"Jordan to Fakhar Zaman, no run, extra bounce, this one gets him high on the thigh pad as he looks to whip it off his hip",
4.4,"Jordan to Fakhar Zaman, FOUR, one bounce into the deep midwicket boundary. Zaman, you beauty. Pitched up on the pads, free swing of the arms as he lets the bottom hand take over. Walloped.",
4.5,"Jordan to Fakhar Zaman, no run, slants this across the batsman, who watches it through to Akmal",
4.6,"Jordan to Fakhar Zaman, 2 runs, leg-stump half-volley hat has been worked into the gap between deep midwicket and long-on",
5.1,"Hasan Ali to Mohammad Rizwan, no run, looks to pull this to Abu Dhabi or somewhere, but swung too early. It was short and the stroke was on. Hasan's pace too good for Rizwan",
5.2,"Hasan Ali to Mohammad Rizwan, no run, play and a miss. Looks to steer it down to third man with an angled bat, the ball deviates late",
5.3,"Hasan Ali to Mohammad Rizwan, FOUR, just manages to clear Jordan at mid-on. Sashays down the pitch and pulls, was cramped for room but went through with the stroke. Intent very clear",
5.4,"Hasan Ali to Mohammad Rizwan, 2 runs, thumped down the ground but not timed as well as he would have liked, Jordan running backwards from mid-off, covered 20 yards or so and then dived full length to get his hands on the ball but couldn't hold on. Outstanding effort, but wouldn't have mattered anyway",
5.5,"Hasan Ali to Mohammad Rizwan, no run, bunts a length ball to point",
5.6,"Hasan Ali to Mohammad Rizwan, 1 run, uses the pace of the bowler to run this down to third man",
6.1,"Wahab Riaz to Mohammad Rizwan, no run, skiddy length ball angled across, chopped to point",
6.2,"Wahab Riaz to Mohammad Rizwan, OUT, his game was bordering on the thin line between being aggressive and over-aggressive, and has paid the price for it. Nowhere near the pitch of the ball as he looks to go over mid-off to slices it to Morgan who comes running in from deep cover, keeps his eyes on the ball and judges the catch to perfection. It was swirling around for a while, but Morgan made it look easy.",
6.3,"Wahab Riaz to Fakhar Zaman, 1 run, turns a length delivery on middle and leg to short midwicket",
6.4,"Wahab Riaz to Narine, 1 run, caught on the back foot to a full delivery, bunts this to point for a quick single",
6.5,"Wahab Riaz to Fakhar Zaman, 1 run, works a length ball to the leg side for a quick single",['Mohammad Rizwan c Morgan b Wahab Riaz 11 (12b 2x4 0x6) SR: 91.66']
6.6,"Wahab Riaz to Narine, 1 run, hustled for pace with a short ball, Narine looks to whip but miscues. Fortunately on the bounce to deep fine leg",
7.1,"Mohammad Hafeez to Narine, OUT, brain freeze. Nothing else can describe what we're seeing. Looks to smash Hafeez into the stands at long-on but can only pick out Jordan in the deep. Why would you want to do that when you're already five down with 13 overs to play? Inexplicable",
7.2,"Mohammad Hafeez to Sohail Tanvir, no run, tossed up on middle and leg, pushed to short midwicket",
7.3,"Mohammad Hafeez to Sohail Tanvir, no run, bunts an in-drifter to the leg side",

8.2,"Wahab Riaz to Sohail Tanvir, no run, opens his wrists late to steer this to backward point",
8.3,"Wahab Riaz to Sohail Tanvir, no run, beaten by a beauty! This one jags away off the seam to beat him on a forceful drive. Looked to play him on the up",
8.4,"Wahab Riaz to Sohail Tanvir, no run, squared up by the length, but somehow manages to get some bat on it. Point comes in quickly to prevent the run",
8.5,"Wahab Riaz to Sohail Tanvir, OUT, this is self-destruction at it's very best. Six down, plenty of overs left. Why would you try to hit it to mid-on and take a run as risky as that? Tanvir was deep inside his crease as he played that short-arm jab. And so he had just that much more ground to cover. Took off late and in the end had given up as the throw hit the stumps direct at the bowler's end. He also made the stupid mistake of running diagonally, which isn't obviously the best way to.",
8.6,"Wahab Riaz to Fakhar Zaman, FOUR, thick edge and past the slip fielder. Third man vacant and so this is a welcome boundary",
9.1,"Shahid Afridi to Bilawal Bhatti, no run, fires in a full ball from wide of the crease, defended to the off side",
9.2,"Shahid Afridi to Bilawal Bhatti, 1 run, short, wide. Cut away to deep point",
9.3,"Shahid Afridi to Fakhar Zaman, no run, width outside off, steered to Sammy at backward point",
9.4,"Shahid Afridi to Fakhar Zaman, 1 run, turned with the spin to square leg",
9.5,"Shahid Afridi to Bilawal Bhatti, no run, beaten by the fizz. This one spins away sharply to beat his forward push. 92kph",['Sohail Tanvir run out 1 (9b 0x4 0x6) SR: 11.11']
9.6,"Shahid Afridi to Bilawal Bhatti, OUT, dragged on! This one was fired in at length, Bhatti goes onto the back foot to whip this away but gets into an awkward tangle. Plays all around it as the ball deflects off his pad back onto the stumps.",
10.1,"Jordan to Fakhar Zaman, OUT, superb catch by Kamran Akmal moving to his left! This is too full for him to ease it behind point, gets a thick edge which Akmal anticipates early and dives to complete the catch.",
10.2,"Jordan to Mohammad Irfan, OUT, all over. Short ball has done the trick. This was coming back in at some pace. Too late on the pull, gets a glove which Kamran Akmal accepts gleefully. This is the lowest score in PSL's short history. Look of disbelief in the Lahore camp. Happened all too quickly. Why? Brain freeze. Too many batsmen came out playing million dollar strokes when the need of the situation was to bide time and play out the overs.",
