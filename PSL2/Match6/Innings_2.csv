1.3,"Sohail Tanvir to Mohammad Hafeez, no run, steps out to smash this over mid-on but is beaten by the late away movement. Why Hafeez, why?",
1.4,"Sohail Tanvir to Mohammad Hafeez, no run, hit high on the thigh pad as he plays all around a length ball on middle. Woefully out of touch",
1.5,"Sohail Tanvir to Mohammad Hafeez, 1 run, too full on middle and leg, nurdled to deep square leg",
1.6,"Sohail Tanvir to Malan, OUT, down the track and across the line a little too much as he looks to flick, but the ball swings back in a long way from outside off. Looks like it hit him on middle and leg. The ball still had some distance to travel but Aleem Dar felt it would have hit the stumps.",['DJ Malan lbw b Sohail Tanvir 1 (3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33']
2.1,"Narine to Mohammad Hafeez, no run, play and a miss. Shaped to play for the turn but this went straight on",
2.2,"Narine to Mohammad Hafeez, OUT, got him, got him. Ripper from Narine. Hafeez completely foxed by the turn. Played for one that goes away, this one sneaked through the big gap between bat and pad. Simplest of stumpings for Rizwan. What's happening here? Hello! Hafeez's dreadful run of form continues",
2.3,"Narine to Morgan, no run, floats a slider across Morgan who lets it go",['Mohammad Hafeez st †Mohammad Rizwan b Narine 3 (11b 0x4 0x6) SR: 27.27']
2.4,"Narine to Morgan, no run, I really don't know how this missed the off stump. Ripper. Squares Morgan up, he plays inside the line.",
2.5,"Narine to Morgan, no run, beaten again! Tentative again, clueless in defense, played for the one that comes in maybe, this one went away to miss the edge.",
2.6,"Narine to Morgan, 1 run, touch too short on middle and leg, worked wide of midwicket",
3.1,"Sohail Tanvir to Morgan, 2 runs, crunching cover drive. Touch too full, Morgan presses forward and eases that on the up. Well done by Irfan, who pulled it back in",

3.3,"Sohail Tanvir to Morgan, 1 run, angles a length ball into middle and leg, tucked wide of midwicket",

5.1,"Mohammad Irfan to Morgan, no run, angles a full delivery across Morgan, hint of movement away too, left alone",
5.2,"Mohammad Irfan to Morgan, FOUR, third man was in business, but he ran in a little too much and then saw the ball sail over. Narine would have gobbled it up had he been on the boundary. Opportunity missed. Poor cricket.",
5.3,"Mohammad Irfan to Kamran Akmal, 1 run, yorker length delivery on middle, squeezed behind the wicket, the slip fielder comes in and has a shy at the stumps at the bowler's end, misses",
5.4,"Mohammad Irfan to Morgan, no run, indecision from Morgan, looked to dab it gently and pinch a run but was sent back. He turned late but got in full stretch. Umar Akmal, coming in from point, anticipated early and under-armed the flick to the stumps at the striker's end. All the good work for nothing",
5.5,"Mohammad Irfan to Morgan, FOUR, steps out and wallops the length ball over mid-on. Didn't get to the pitch of the ball but went through with the stroke. The confidence of a man who made 80 in the previous game",

6.6,"Bilawal Bhatti to Kamran Akmal, 1 run",
7.1,"Yasir Shah to Kamran Akmal, OUT, excellent catch coming in from deep cover. Qalandars making Zalmi fight for every run. Kamran lofts it up and over the infield, but couldn't generate the kind of power he would have liked. It wasn't a chip, neither was it a full-blooded stroke. Poor from a seasoned campaigner.",
7.2,"Yasir Shah to Shahid Afridi, no run, gets forward and blocks",
7.3,"Yasir Shah to Shahid Afridi, no run, would you believe it? He's defended a tossed up delivery gently to the off side",['Kamran Akmal c Elliott b Yasir Shah 3 (13b 0x4 0x6) SR: 23.07']

7.6,"Yasir Shah to Shahid Afridi, no run, drifting into middle and leg, he gets forward and deadbats that",

8.6,"Bilawal Bhatti to Morgan, no run, looks to pull, ball thuds into the bat because of the pace. Impact makes bat face turn in Morgan's hand, rolls to mid-off",
9.1,"Yasir Shah to Shahid Afridi, no run, play and a miss. Looked to cut but was beaten by the fizz",
9.2,"Yasir Shah to Shahid Afridi, no run, have you ever seen Afridi try to drop and run in recent times? That's what he tries to do, but point comes in quickly to prevent that",
9.3,"Yasir Shah to Shahid Afridi, 1 run, flat hit. Advances down the track and drills it to long-off on the bounce",

9.5,"Yasir Shah to Shahid Afridi, no run, width outside off, he cuts but straight to point again",
9.6,"Yasir Shah to Shahid Afridi, no run, big heave to the leg side, except he connected with the humid Dubai air. Deceived him flight",

10.5,"Narine to Shahid Afridi, no run, what does he do next? Shows he can defend solidly too",
10.6,"Narine to Shahid Afridi, OUT, he's hit this towards the longer boundary, where Elliott takes a simple catch at deep midwicket. His daughters didn't approve of the shot. Once again didn't get to the pitch of the ball and ended up dragging it leg dside.",
11.1,"Yasir Shah to Sohaib Maqsood, no run, driven with the spin to extra cover",
11.2,"Yasir Shah to Sohaib Maqsood, no run, one-handed stop by McCullum at cover point. Flung himself to the left to stop that",

11.4,"Yasir Shah to Sohaib Maqsood, OUT, ripper of a catch from the skipper. There's life in this contest yet? The dip has got him the wicket. Maqsood was through with a booming drive, but didn't account for the turn, neither did he get to the pitch of the ball and simply chipped it to the off side where superman in the form of McCullum dived full length to his left to pluck a one-handed stunner",
11.5,"Yasir Shah to Sammy, 1 run, touch short, Sammy rocks back and steers this wide of point to get off the mark",
11.6,"Yasir Shah to Morgan, OUT, Aleem Dar thought long, hard, really hard. Even harder. And then raised his finger. This delivery was full, spun back in to beat Morgan's push and hit him on the pad. The ball deflected to short leg. The only question was if it would have missed the stumps, but it looks like Aleem has give him caught. Snicko showed nothing.",

13.2,"Yasir Shah to Sammy, no run, tossed up on off, Sammy stretches forward and blocks",
13.3,"Yasir Shah to Sammy, no run, played outside the line and is lucky to get some bat on it as he defends",
13.4,"Yasir Shah to Sammy, OUT, you beauty! The wrong'un was coming, Sammy was completely foxed as he shaped to drive, played outside the line, got a big inside edge that deflected off the boot and onto the middle stump. Yasir does a Tahir, takes off on a 100-metre dash. What is happening here? If ever there was a manual on how not to approach a modest chase, this is it.",
13.5,"Yasir Shah to Wahab Riaz, no run, out, surely? Big, big, big appeal. The ball drifted in full from wide of the crease, went for a sweep and was struck on the back pad. Aleem Dar didn't think it straightened enough. Proved right by Hawkeye",

14.4,"Bilawal Bhatti to Wahab Riaz, no run, looks to wallop this across the line, struck on the pad but umpire Illingworth is firm. Was missing leg stump",

14.6,"Bilawal Bhatti to Wahab Riaz, no run, caught hopping and jumping again. In-dipper that strikes him high on the pad as he looks to turn it to the leg side.",

16.2,"Elliott to Wahab Riaz, 1 run, swung across the line to long-on",
16.3,"Elliott to Jordan, no run, looks for a single but is sent back. Backward square leg swooped in on the ball very quickly",
16.4,"Elliott to Jordan, no run, width outside off, punched to cover. There's a direct hit at the bowler's end but the non-striker was in. What awareness from McCullum",
16.5,"Elliott to Jordan, 1 run, too late to pick up and release. McCullum not happy with the effort at short fine leg",
16.6,"Elliott to Wahab Riaz, 2 runs, game, set and match. Too full outside off, he squeezes this into the gap between point and short third man. Hardly any smiles in the Zalmi camp. Relief more than elation. They've been made to earn this win courtesy some aggressive captaincy from McCullum backed up by some outstanding bowling, especially from Yasir Shah",
