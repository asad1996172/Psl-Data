0.1,"Imran Khalid to Roy, 1 run, fired in on leg, worked away to deep midwicket",
0.2,"Imran Khalid to McCullum, FOUR, that is not good bowling. Flat down leg, McCullum helps himself to four to backward square leg.",
0.3,"Imran Khalid to McCullum, FOUR, over mid-on. A tad too full, McCullum clears his front leg and powers one over the fielder. Very similar to the way he got out yesterday, but got underneath this enough",
0.4,"Imran Khalid to McCullum, no run, hammered back to the bowler",
0.5,"Imran Khalid to McCullum, SIX, flat down leg, McCullum goes back and slogs the ball waaay over midwicket. Those short boundaries again. Easy hitting",

1.4,"Mohammad Sami to Roy, FOUR, full outside off, Roy mis-times his wild heave and the ball clears mid-off. Four more. Wanted to go over mid-on, but does it really matter?",
1.5,"Mohammad Sami to Roy, no run, worked away to midwicket",
1.6,"Mohammad Sami to Roy, FOUR, four more. Back of a length on off, Roy was looking at midwicket but the ball flies off the bat straight over the bowler. Looked at one point like it had gone straight up. But he had enough to clear the infield and almost hit the rope on the full. Bounced just inside though",
2.1,"Rumman Raees to McCullum, no run, beautiful slower ball. Flummoxed McCullum, too early into his shot",
2.2,"Rumman Raees to McCullum, 2 runs, just enough to clear mid-off. An excellent effort. Full delivery on off, McCullum mis-times his bunt. Sami runs after it and dives full-length but just can't get close enough.",
2.3,"Rumman Raees to McCullum, OUT, gone! McCullum picks out the fielder at deep square leg. A length delivery from Raees, McCullum swings but gets it off the toe end. Hangs in the air for a while, Billings is lurking at the square leg boundary and takes an easy catch. Key moment in the game. An over or two more of Baz and this game may have gone out of reach",['BB McCullum c Billings b Rumman Raees 25 (10b 4x4 1x6) SR: 250.00']

3.5,"Mohammad Sami to Fakhar Zaman, no run, driven away towards extra cover from the crease",
3.6,"Mohammad Sami to Fakhar Zaman, OUT, one more. Zaman's stuttering, spluttering innings ends. A short delivery on middle and leg, Zaman wanted to pull but got nowhere near enough on his stroke. The ball lobs up off the splice towards short midwicket. Sami gets across and claims an easy catch",

4.3,"Rumman Raees to Umar Akmal, no run, played away towards backward point. That's 2",
4.4,"Rumman Raees to Umar Akmal, 1 run, superb fielding from Asif. A thick outside edge from Akmal, races away to third man's left. He makes sure he is not in contact with the ball and the boundary at the same time while diving. Fantastic stuff",
4.5,"Rumman Raees to Roy, 1 run, worked away to deep backward square leg",

8.1,"Shadab Khan to Roy, 1 run, pushed through again, Roy sits back and slaps a cut to the sweeper cover",

11.1,"Saeed Ajmal to Roy, no run, flat delivery outside off, Roy misses his slog sweep. Haddin appeals after taking off the bails. The third umpire is called upon. Roy's bat is not down. His back foot is on the line, and that should be out. Is there something behind the crease? Doesn't look like it. Is there enough doubt for the batsman? Yes, says the umpire. Wow. That was out to my eyes.",
11.2,"Saeed Ajmal to Roy, 1 run, clipped away to square leg for a run",
11.3,"Saeed Ajmal to Umar Akmal, SIX, a tad short and Akmal rocks back to pull over midwicket. Read the length so quickly there. Went right back and generated enough power",

15.4,"Saeed Ajmal to Elliott, OUT, still in it are Islamabad. Flat delivery outside off, Elliott sweeps but gets a top edge which is easily taken by deep backward square leg. Always a risk playing with a cross bat to Ajmal because of the number of revs he imparts.",
