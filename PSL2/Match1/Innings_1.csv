0.1,"Mohammad Irfan to Mohammad Hafeez, OUT, dramatic start! Hafeez's age old problem of poking at away-going deliveries results in his downfall. This one is full and angling away, he plays a loose drive, no feet movement whatsoever, and the thick edge is pouched at second slip. Straightforward catch, as simple as they come",['Mohammad Hafeez c Sharjeel Khan b Mohammad Irfan 0 (1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00']

2.4,"Mohammad Irfan to Kamran Akmal, no run, too full, feet rooted to the crease as he stabs that to the off side",
2.5,"Mohammad Irfan to Kamran Akmal, SIX, this is stunning! You can pay a lot of money to watch someone hit a fast bowler coming in at 140 clicks inside-out over extra cover.

4.2,"Watson to Kamran Akmal, 1 run, bullet drive down to mid-on",
4.3,"Watson to Malan, SIX, steps out to a short ball, goes through with the pull. Looks like he top edged it but the ball still had enough for it to sail over fine leg. Frustration for Watson. Saw the batsman give him the charge and banged it in, and still watched the ball sail over",
4.4,"Watson to Malan, no run, yorker-length delivery outside off, shapes back in a wee bit, he looks to drive and misses",
4.5,"Watson to Malan, FOUR, crashed into the extra cover boundary. There was a man in the deep precisely to stop that but he stood no chance. Delightful",

6.2,"Saeed Ajmal to Kamran Akmal, SIX, it seems to me as if he was batting somewhere else before coming out to bat here. Tossed up on middle, he gets down on one knee and sweeps him into the deep midwicket boundary. Exhilarating stuff",

7.5,"Imran Khalid to Kamran Akmal, 1 run, paddled with the angle to deep square. Half-century for Kamran Akmal. Believe me, this has been a super knock. Lifts his hand and bat to acknowledge the dressing room. He's looked in total control",

8.1,"Saeed Ajmal to Kamran Akmal, 1 run, backs away and lofts the full delivery over the infield to sweeper cover",

8.3,"Saeed Ajmal to Malan, SIX, massive hit, 10 rows back at deep midwicket. Gets underneath the flight and slog sweeps him out of the ground. One million rupees up for grabs for whoever catches it in the stands. A number of them went for it but none could get their hands on it.",

12.2,"Saeed Ajmal to Morgan, no run, drifting into middle, pushed back tentatively to the bowler",

The umpires conferred to see if the ball hit the stumps off the keeper's pad, but replays indicate there was absolutely no doubt. Morgan's first outing here today has been far from a memorable one",

12.5,"Saeed Ajmal to Kamran Akmal, 1 run, delicate little late cut to short third man. Touch of risk but he's in fine form, and so had the confidence to play it off the keeper's gloves",['EJG Morgan b Saeed Ajmal 1 (3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33']

15.3,"Mohammad Sami to Kamran Akmal, OUT, it was short, there to be hit. Kamran struck it well but found square leg. End of an exhilarating innings. Pays the price for trying to fetch it from outside off. Extra pace of Sami did the trick there for Islamabad Stunning knock",
15.4,"Mohammad Sami to Sammy, no run, cut away, but straight to point",
15.5,"Mohammad Sami to Sammy, no run, play and a miss. Looked to slap that over point, but it was too full",

16.2,"Mohammad Irfan to Sammy, SIX, pulled, and pulled well. Ungainly looking swing, but he managed to get enough bat on it to clear deep midwicket. For a moment it looked like the timing was off there as the bat face turned in his hands, but he's got strong forearms",

17.3,"Watson to Haris Sohail, 1 run, low full toss angling away, pushed wide of the man at cover",
17.4,"Watson to Shahid Afridi, OUT, dolly for Misbah at midwicket. The short ball has done the trick for Watson again. Afridi looks to pull but is once again beaten for pace as Watson dug this in short, got it off the top half of the bat and Misbah made no mistake. Afridi reacted a fraction of a second late there, really at this level, that's all is the difference between a big shot and a miscue",
17.5,"Watson to Haris Sohail, OUT, healthy nick through to Haddin. Once again the short ball has done the trick. Looked to pull off the front foot, but the ball got big on him and flew off the edge to the keeper. How Zalmi have collapsed!",

18.4,"Mohammad Sami to Jordan, 1 run, chopped wide of Haddin on the off side as they scamper a run",
18.5,"Mohammad Sami to Iftikhar Ahmed, OUT, sensational from Haddin. Retired from international cricket but still has enough in this old legs. This pull was top-edged, it flew straight over his head. Fine leg was running in, but Haddin, who ran nearly 30 yards backwards, called for it and made it look ridiculously simple. These kind of catches - running backwards - can't be easy",['Haris Sohail c †Haddin b Watson 12 (14b 0x4 0x6) SR: 85.71']
18.6,"Mohammad Sami to Jordan, 1 run, flicked with the angle to the man at deep midwicket",
19.1,"Watson to Jordan, FOUR, lofted one bounce to the long-off boundary. Low full toss, he made room and simply hit through the line. The key there was he didn't try to hit it hard",
