Ball,Commentary,Wicket
0.1,"Junaid Khan to Smith, FOUR, what a welcome to the bowling crease. Nothing wrong with the delivery, a length ball that nips away off the seam from off stump, Smith plants forward and plays a sumptuous off drive that beats mid-off",
0.2,"Junaid Khan to Smith, no run, gets forward and bunts this to cover",
0.3,"Junaid Khan to Smith, FOUR, too full and angling back in, Smith gets to the pitch of the ball and loft him through the line, clears mid-on, couple of bounces into the boundary. Touch too full from Junaid",
0.4,"Junaid Khan to Smith, 1 run, pulls but doesn't entirely get hold of it, down to square leg",
0.5,"Junaid Khan to Sharjeel Khan, 1 run, typical whip off his hip from Sharjeel, to deep square leg",
0.6,"Junaid Khan to Smith, FOUR, flayed on the up between cover and point. Ah, the confidence to simply hit through the line without worrying about swing and seam movement, something else",
1.1,"Hasan Ali to Sharjeel Khan, no run, punches a length ball to cover point",
1.2,"Hasan Ali to Sharjeel Khan, no run, gets to the pitch of the ball and drives to mid-off",
1.3,"Hasan Ali to Sharjeel Khan, OUT, big appeal for lbw and they've got him. Interesting to see if the ball pitched outside leg. Sharjeel looks to whip it across the line but misses it completely. That surely would have gone on to hit the stumps. Big, big wicket first up for Peshawar Zalmi",['Sharjeel Khan lbw b Hasan Ali 1 (4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 25.00']
1.4,"Hasan Ali to Haddin, FOUR, driven uppishly and into the gap between cover and point. Didn't get to the pitch, but he went through with the stroke. Sliced it over the infield as the bat face turned in his hand",
1.5,"Hasan Ali to Haddin, no run, jags back into middle from length, defended back down the pitch",
1.6,"Hasan Ali to Haddin, 1 run, bunts this to extra cover, quick single taken. The fielder was lat to get off the blocks",
2.1,"Jordan to Haddin, 1 run, floats a full length delivery on off from wide of the crease, eased into the off side for a quick single",
2.2,"Jordan to Smith, no run, induces the edge but put down at slip by Darren Sammy. Minute deviation off the pitch. He jabs at the ball with hard hands, gets a thick edge. Oh, dear. Should have been taken.",
2.3,"Jordan to Smith, 1 run, lofted but not timed all that well, deep point goes around to deep cover to stop that",
2.4,"Jordan to Haddin, FOUR, just over mid-off. Not timed all that well but enough to clear the infield and get a boundary. Intention right from Haddin, that of going after the bowlers and maximise the powerplay overs",
2.5,"Jordan to Haddin, no run, leg-cutter that is fuller in length, looks to flay that through point, gets a bottom edge that rolls to slip",
2.6,"Jordan to Haddin, 1 run, dabs a full delivery gently to the man coming in from cover, quick single taken",
3.1,"Hasan Ali to Haddin, no run, pulls and misses. Was way too early into the stroke, although I must say the shot was on",
3.2,"Hasan Ali to Haddin, 1 run, full delivery on middle, dabbed to short cover as they scamper a quick single",
3.3,"Hasan Ali to Smith, no run, play and a miss. Beaten by the late movement. Feet glued to the crease as he threw his bat at that length ball that nipped away",
3.4,"Hasan Ali to Smith, no run, looks to swing this over the long-off boundary but played too early. Beaten in the end",
3.5,"Hasan Ali to Smith, 1 run, brings his wrists into the picture as he fetches a length delivery from outside off, down to deep square leg",
3.6,"Hasan Ali to Haddin, 1 run, sliced down to third man. Intended to hit it over cover",
4.1,"Junaid Khan to Haddin, 1 run, uses the pace to run it down to third man",
4.2,"Junaid Khan to Smith, no run, bangs a short ball on middle and leg, Smith ducks under that one",
4.3,"Junaid Khan to Smith, no run, runs his fingers across the seam this time, lands it on middle and gets the ball to move away a bit, Smith was too early into the pull. In no position in the end",
4.4,"Junaid Khan to Smith, no run, looks to slash this over point, but doesn't have the room. Beaten",
4.5,"Junaid Khan to Smith, no run, off-cutter again, Mustafizur style. Smith is premeditating his shots and it's clearly not working. Beaten again",
4.6,"Junaid Khan to Smith, no run, pulls, misses. Through with the shot early, got some pad along the way to the keeper on the bounce",
5.1,"Jordan to Haddin, FOUR, slapped over cover, no protection in the deep. This time the timing is immaculate",
5.2,"Jordan to Haddin, 1 run, knuckle ball, was it? Held on to the surface as Haddin jabbed at that delivery, manages to get this towards mid-on for a quick single",
5.3,"Jordan to Smith, no run, looks to fetch a whip from outside off to midwicket, gets a thick inside edge on the pad instead",
5.4,"Jordan to Smith, no run, late on the stroke. The ball snakes back in late from wide of the crease to beat the flick and hit Smith on the pad. Angle would have take it down leg, and so they didn't bother appealing",

5.6,"Jordan to Haddin, 1 run, sliding down leg, helped on its way but can't beat short fine leg",

6.2,"Shahid Afridi to Haddin, SIX, this has been clobbered over deep midwicket. Drifts this in from wide of the crease, Haddin swings across the line and gets enough elevation",
6.3,"Shahid Afridi to Haddin, 1 run, chopped to short third man as they scamper a quick single",
6.4,"Shahid Afridi to Smith, 2 runs, clubbed down the ground, long-off does well but can't stop it cleanly to give away a second",
6.5,"Shahid Afridi to Smith, no run, looks to cut, didn't have the room. Hit back to the bowler",
6.6,"Shahid Afridi to Smith, no run, forced off the back foot to point. This one spun away a little more and took the splice of the bat",
7.1,"Sammy to Haddin, 1 run, short ball outside off, slapped down to long-on. Looks like he's broken his bat. He's looking at the handle",
7.2,"Sammy to Smith, no run, this one keeps low and so the attempted pull is thwarted as Smith is hit low on his pad. The ball was sliding down leg, however",
7.3,"Sammy to Smith, 1 leg bye, flicks and misses, the ball deflects off the pad to square leg",
7.4,"Sammy to Haddin, 1 run, pulled in front of square to Hafeez at deep midwicket",
7.5,"Sammy to Smith, no run, right into the blockhole, it was the slower delivery as well, squeezed back down the pitch",
7.6,"Sammy to Smith, SIX, biffed into the deep midwicket boundary. Monstrous hit! Too short and Smith was waiting for the release shot",

9.1,"Sammy to Haddin, 1 run, slapped across the line to wide long-on",
9.2,"Sammy to Smith, 1 leg bye, gets into an awful mess as he looks to pull an incoming delivery, hit on the pad but they steal a run nevetheless",
9.3,"Sammy to Haddin, no run, walks across the stumps to slash that over point but misses. And because he made that early movement, that hasn't been called wide",
9.4,"Sammy to Haddin, FOUR, innovative, cheeky, outstanding! Haddin gets outside the line of the stumps and picks this away behind square on the leg side.",
9.5,"Sammy to Haddin, no run, angles a full delivery on middle, defended back down the pitch",
9.6,"Sammy to Haddin, 2 runs, swung across the line to wide long-on, excellent running to get back for the second",

10.2,"Shahid Afridi to Smith, FOUR, width on offer and he's clobbered that into the deep point boundary. Easy pickings.",

10.4,"Shahid Afridi to Haddin, 1 run, toe-ends an attempted lofted hit to long-on",
10.5,"Shahid Afridi to Smith, no run, can't bisect short third man and point. It was short, he hit that hard but straight to the fielder",
10.6,"Shahid Afridi to Smith, 1 run, gets to the pitch of the ball and eases it to sweeper cover",
11.1,"Hasan Ali to Smith, 1 run, looks to play a short-arm jab but the ball skids on to hit the pad, looks like there was an inside edge",
11.2,"Hasan Ali to Haddin, SIX, picked the bones out of that one! Sitting up nicely for him to play the pull in front of square. Latched onto it in a jiffy, just manages to clear deep midwicket",
11.3,"Hasan Ali to Haddin, 2 runs, drilled down to wide long-on, the man there had some work to do, the throw was weak to and they were back for the second comfortably",
11.4,"Hasan Ali to Haddin, 1 run, flicked, one bounce to deep backward square leg. Lucky to get away with a leg-stump half-volley",
11.5,"Hasan Ali to Smith, 1 run, into the blockhole, squeezed off a thick inside edge to square leg",
11.6,"Hasan Ali to Haddin, 1 run, swung leg side, gets a thick inside edge to short fine leg, one run is all it will be",
12.1,"Junaid Khan to Haddin, FOUR, that is a stunner. Did someone say Haddin has retired? Wow, is he available to play in India? Makes room and goes inside-out over extra cover, timed it so beautifully, Sohail was the man in the deep, but he had no control over the ball as he tried to pull it back. One bounce into the boundary",
12.2,"Junaid Khan to Haddin, 1 run, steered to short third man as they complete a risky run",
12.3,"Junaid Khan to Smith, 1 run, right into the blockhole, squeezed past midwicket",
12.4,"Junaid Khan to Haddin, FOUR, makes room and then uses the pace of the bowler to glide this over short third man. What awareness",
12.5,"Junaid Khan to Haddin, SIX, once again goes over cover, Sohail was lurking around the ropes in the deep, but was off balance as he landed. His back foot was touching the rope even before he could release the ball. Multiple replays can't prove conclusive, so six it will be.",
12.6,"Junaid Khan to Haddin, 1 run, walloped over midwicket, down to wide long-on",
13.1,"Jordan to Haddin, OUT, the change of bowling has done the trick. This was slower and fuller outside off, he looks to go over cover but is deceived by the change in pace, plays too early and ends up getting a thin edge that is gleefully accepted by Kamran Akmal. End of a super knock that has kept Islamabad alive",
13.2,"Jordan to Watson, FOUR, poor delivery first up to a new batsman. Full and sliding down leg, all Watson needed to do was get some bat on it, which he did. Raced away into the fine leg boundary. Jordan knew immediately that he had erred",['BJ Haddin c †Kamran Akmal b Jordan 73 (39b 8x4 3x6) SR: 187.17']
13.3,"Jordan to Watson, 1 run, steered off the back foot to deep cover",
13.4,"Jordan to Smith, 1 run, sliced down to third man. Bat face turned in his hand as he tried to dig the yorker out",
13.5,"Jordan to Watson, no run, length too full and straight outside off, Watson looks to run it down to third man but plays inside the line of the ball",
13.6,"Jordan to Watson, no run, toe-ends an attempted drive to mid-off",
14.1,"Sammy to Smith, 4 leg byes, skids a full ball back in from wide of the crease, Smith looks to play a short-arm jab but is hurried onto the stroke. The ball deflects off his pad into the third man boundary. Lucky runs, Sammy can't believe how that went to the boundary",
14.2,"Sammy to Smith, 1 run, swept down to deep square leg",
14.3,"Sammy to Watson, 1 run, flayed on the up to deep cover",
14.4,"Sammy to Smith, FOUR, wow, that's as interesting as they come! Absolutely smashed down the ground off the middle, but Watson can't get out of the way of that rocket hit at the non-striker's end. Hits the bat and deflects into the wide long-on boundary",
14.5,"Sammy to Smith, no run, yorker-length delivery down leg, looks to flick but can only get some pad on it. Sammy runs to his left quickly, picks the ball up and hurls a throw at the striker's end. Smith was miles outside his crease and would have been run-out had that hit",
14.6,"Sammy to Smith, FOUR, length ball down leg, Smith gets across and helps it to the left of short fine leg. Poor, poor bowling this. Easy pickings",
15.1,"Hasan Ali to Watson, 1 run, into the blockhole, squeezed to long-off",
15.2,"Hasan Ali to Smith, FOUR, scythes this into the gap between deep cover and long-off. Stand and deliver. Too full and he got underneath the line to muscle that away",
15.3,"Hasan Ali to Smith, 1 run, yorker-length delivery, turns out to be a low full toss that has been squeezed to long-on",
15.4,"Hasan Ali to Watson, no run, play and a miss. Looks to carve this over cover, but played too late.",
15.5,"Hasan Ali to Watson, 1 run, looks to hoick this across the line over cow corner, gets a thick inside edge onto the pad, ball deflects to the off side",
15.6,"Hasan Ali to Smith, 1 run, drilled to long-off. What punch and timing",
16.1,"Junaid Khan to Smith, 1 run, low full toss on middle from around the stumps, pushed to long-off",
16.2,"Junaid Khan to Watson, SIX, comes back to over the wicket, but the result is the same. Another full toss, another swing across the line. This time it's over long-on. Poor from a man of Junaid's experience. Surely that's that as far as the game is concerned?",
16.3,"Junaid Khan to Watson, FOUR, this time he pitches short, Watson is waiting for it as he pulls him in front of square, one bounce into the deep midwicket boundary",
16.4,"Junaid Khan to Watson, 1 run, doesn't get hold of the pull as well as he would have liked this time, down to wide long-on",
16.5,"Junaid Khan to Smith, no run, looks to slash over point but was cramped for room, beaten",
16.6,"Junaid Khan to Smith, OUT, dolly of a catch to long-on. What was the need to look for an ugly hoick, you must ask. Smith looks to back away and slog across the line but it was a slower delivery and so he's completely deceived by the change in pace. Was through with the stroke, which he checked at the last moment, as the ball lobbed to the fielder. He's played well though, a half-century during the course of two important partnerships",
17.1,"Jordan to Billings, 1 run, into the blockhole, squeezed to long-on. Sensible from Billings",['DR Smith c Jordan b Junaid Khan 55 (49b 8x4 1x6) SR: 112.24']
17.2,"Jordan to Watson, 1 run, slashed to point, they steal a run. Good stop there but Billings was halfway through the run when Watson took off. Watson wasn't running to the danger end and so was happy to get across anyway",
17.3,"Jordan to Billings, 2 runs, steered into the gap at deep extra cover, easy two there",
17.4,"Jordan to Billings, FOUR, pulled into the gap, signs off with a boundary! Crunched that into the gap superbly. First win of PSL 2017 belongs to defending champs Islamabad United",
