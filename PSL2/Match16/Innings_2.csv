Ball,Commentary,Wicket
0.1,"Hasan Ali to Delport, 1 run, goes at it with hard hands as he chases a wide ball outside off and sends it to third man off the outside edge",
0.2,"Hasan Ali to McCullum, 1 run, length ball on off, nudged to midwicket",
0.3,"Hasan Ali to Delport, FOUR, comes down the track and meets the pitch of this fuller ball through mid-on and the ball goes to the left of the fielder there as it goes into the boundary",
0.4,"Hasan Ali to Delport, no run, looks to hit through the leg side but is beaten by pace and wears it on the thigh pad",
0.5,"Hasan Ali to Delport, 1 run, comes down the track and looks to go big over the off-side, gets a healthy outside edge and the ball goes on the bounce to the fielder at third man who runs to his right and fields it",
0.6,"Hasan Ali to McCullum, FOUR, comes down the track to get on top of this one and flays it over mid-on with a flat bat. Seemed like a catch momentarily but it has sailed well over the fielder there",
1.1,"Mohammad Asghar to Delport, FOUR, fired full on off, gets down and sweeps through square leg",
1.2,"Mohammad Asghar to Delport, FOUR, comes down the track and meets the pitch of the ball before crunching it down the ground for a straight boundary. The ball goes over the long-on boundary on the bounce",
1.3,"Mohammad Asghar to Delport, FOUR, drags the length back and fires this on leg stump. Overcompensates with the length and it is pulled away through the fine leg region",
1.4,"Mohammad Asghar to Delport, FOUR, oh, dear. Long-on came up to mid-on and the batsman steps down the track and lofts this cleanly over the fielder who is inside the circle. Comes down early and flicks it straight down the ground. Not much turn on the ball and he is able to easily loft it",
1.5,"Mohammad Asghar to Delport, 2 runs, backs away to this short ball, waits for this one to spin and come on to him before knocking it through covers",
1.6,"Mohammad Asghar to Delport, FOUR, make that five in the over. Pitched up leg stumps, advances down the track and lofts it flat and clean over mid-on",
2.1,"Hasan Ali to McCullum, 1 run, short ball, mistimes the pull to square leg as it hit the high part of the bat",
2.2,"Hasan Ali to Delport, no run, short ball, tries to pull it away but it is pushed across the left-hander and the angle makes it hard for him to make contact as he went at it with his feet rooted to the crease",
2.3,"Hasan Ali to Delport, no run, this time he backs away and tries to pull. It's not as wide this time, in fact too close to pull and hence he makes no contact",
2.4,"Hasan Ali to Delport, no run, backs away and responds with a pull shot to this short ball but he mistimes it and chops towards wide mid-on",
2.5,"Hasan Ali to Delport, FOUR, finally makes proper connection on the pull shot. Sits up nicely for Delport and he rolls his wrists over it as the ball runs away into the deep backward square leg boundary",
2.6,"Hasan Ali to Delport, OUT, well, well, that is some brave bowling. Persists with the short ball and it fetches him reward. He saw Delport taking his eyes off the previous ball late into the shot and probably had the feeling he was not as comfortable against the short ball. So he bangs one in and Delport came down the track and looked to pull. Skies it off the top edge and the wicketkeeper and bowler converge. Hasan says mine and takes a superbly-judged catch. That stayed up for a long time and he did well to get under it",['CS Delport c & b Hasan Ali 32 (15b 7x4 0x6) SR: 213.33']
3.1,"Mohammad Hafeez to Fakhar Zaman, no run, tossed up on leg, pushed back to the bowler",
3.2,"Mohammad Hafeez to Fakhar Zaman, OUT, chipped straight down the throat of long-on and Zaman falls for a second-ball duck as Hafeez strikes almost immediately after being brought in. He came down the track and lofted it but did not get hold of it. Cannot clear the boundary as it goes to Wahab Riaz who takes it comfortably. And a mild drizzle had begun even as Zaman is walking off",
3.3,"Mohammad Hafeez to Umar Akmal, no run, tries to come forward and flick this away into the leg side but skews it off the leading edge to backward point",['Fakhar Zaman c Wahab Riaz b Mohammad Hafeez 0 (2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00']
3.4,"Mohammad Hafeez to Umar Akmal, OUT, yes-and-no and McCullum is back, seems like. Umar came forward and pushed it straight to mid-on. Umar calls McCullum for a run and realises he has hit it straight to the fielder and sends back his captain. All the fielder needed to do was fire a direct hit and he does it superbly and McCullum is a mile out",
3.5,"Mohammad Hafeez to Umar Akmal, no run, stays in the crease and turns it away to the midwicket region",
3.6,"Mohammad Hafeez to Umar Akmal, 1 run, fuller, clipped off the pads between midwicket and mid-on",['BB McCullum run out 6 (3b 1x4 0x6) SR: 200.00']
4.1,"Shakib Al Hasan to Umar Akmal, OUT, traps him in front and that looked close. Umpire raises his finger and Umar Akmal is on his way back. Just like that four wickets have gone, for the addition of just one run. It was a loopy delivery from Shakib, comes on with the arm on middle and leg channel. It does not turn much and comes on with the arm. Umar was playing for the turn and the ball beats his inside edge and strikes him on the pad. Boy are Lahore unravelling here",
4.2,"Shakib Al Hasan to Elliott, no run, sliding in with the arm again and this one spins a lot more, goes off the outer part of the bat as the batsman comes forward to defend and goes into the off side",
4.3,"Shakib Al Hasan to Elliott, no run, defended into the covers",
4.4,"Shakib Al Hasan to Elliott, OUT, looks plumb and gone again. Elliott came forward to play this one but the ball again comes on with the arm and hits him below the shin. That was a lot more plumb than the earlier one. Seemed to be hitting in line with middle. And the rain has arrived again. They are continuing for now, though",['Umar Akmal lbw b Shakib Al Hasan 1 (5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 20.00']
4.5,"Shakib Al Hasan to Narine, no run, stumping chance, referred upstairs. Narine comes forward and expects it to spin. But it does not and he gets beaten as the ball comes on straight and beats the outside edge. The backfoot did not come off and he is safe",
4.6,"Shakib Al Hasan to Narine, no run, gets down to sweep and works it to backward square leg where a brilliant stop is made",
5.1,"Mohammad Hafeez to Mohammad Rizwan, FOUR, short, wide, backs away to make room and cuts through covers, gets it to the left of the fielder there",
5.2,"Mohammad Hafeez to Mohammad Rizwan, no run, stays back to this length ball and defends off the inner part of the bat",['GD Elliott lbw b Shakib Al Hasan 0 (3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00']
5.3,"Mohammad Hafeez to Mohammad Rizwan, no run, stays back and defends to the off side",
5.4,"Mohammad Hafeez to Mohammad Rizwan, OUT, absolute peach from Hafeez. Takes the outside edge. Length ball, Rizwan is forward looking to play for the turn. But it straightens and goes the other way, takes the outside edge, hits him on the back pad and that is a smart, sharp catch by the keeper. Came on to him quickly and he did well to close his hands around it",
5.5,"Mohammad Hafeez to Aamer Yamin, 1 run, floats it up on leg, clipped to midwicket where a misfield allows the single",
5.6,"Mohammad Hafeez to Narine, 1 run, pitched up on middle and leg, pushed down to long-on",
6.1,"Shakib Al Hasan to Narine, 1 run, opens the bat face and runs it down to backward point",
6.2,"Shakib Al Hasan to Aamer Yamin, FOUR, pitched up on middle and Yamin gets down on one knee, slog sweeps into the vacant deep midwicket region as the ball beats the deep square leg fielder running across into the boundary",['Mohammad Rizwan c †Kamran Akmal b Mohammad Hafeez 4 (4b 1x4 0x6) SR: 100.00']
6.3,"Shakib Al Hasan to Aamer Yamin, no run, blocked into the off side",
6.4,"Shakib Al Hasan to Aamer Yamin, 1 run, comes forward and pushes it off the front foot to long-off",
6.5,"Shakib Al Hasan to Narine, 1 run, stays in the crease and tucks it away into the leg side, through the square leg region",
6.6,"Shakib Al Hasan to Aamer Yamin, SIX, shot. Pitched up outside off, offers up enough width for the batsman to free his arms and in the slot for Yamin as he opens up his arms and crunches it straight down the ground. Heaves it muscularly and that goes clean and some distance into the stands",
7.1,"Mohammad Hafeez to Narine, FOUR, comes down the track and lofts this after getting on top of it straight down the ground as the ball goes on the bounce and over the boundary",
7.2,"Mohammad Hafeez to Narine, SIX, pitched up generously and Narine comes down the track to get on top of it before crashing it straight down the ground again. This time the connection is even sweeter and as is the result as the ball crashes into the sightscreen",
7.3,"Mohammad Hafeez to Narine, 1 run, flat ball, worked to long-off",
7.4,"Mohammad Hafeez to Aamer Yamin, no run, comes down the track and Hafeez does well to drag the length back forcing the batsman to defend it",
7.5,"Mohammad Hafeez to Aamer Yamin, SIX, switches back to a fullish length and this one's heading down leg after being tossed up. Yamin gets down to slog sweep and the ball goes over deep square leg",
7.6,"Mohammad Hafeez to Aamer Yamin, 1 run, slog sweep again and this time the ball goes to the deep backward square leg fielder as he does not make as good connection",
8.1,"Wahab Riaz to Aamer Yamin, no run, short of good length ball, stays in the crease and dabs it away into the leg side",
8.2,"Wahab Riaz to Aamer Yamin, no run, short of a length, tries to tuck it away and is late in closing the face of his bat as the ball skewed back towards the bowler",
8.3,"Wahab Riaz to Aamer Yamin, no run, shorter ball, backs away and opens the bat face to run it down towards third man but does not make contact as he gets cramped for room",
8.4,"Wahab Riaz to Aamer Yamin, FOUR, uses the pace on that occasion. Length ball, angling away outside off and he drops the wrists late and opens the bat face to steer it to third man",
8.5,"Wahab Riaz to Aamer Yamin, no run, jumps up to deal with the bounce on this one and stabs it to backward point",
8.6,"Wahab Riaz to Aamer Yamin, no run, good length on the stumps, blocked quietly back to the bowler",
9.1,"Shahid Afridi to Narine, no run, pushed across to the left-hander from over the wicket. Defended from the crease",

9.3,"Shahid Afridi to Aamer Yamin, no run",
9.4,"Shahid Afridi to Aamer Yamin, no run, gets down to slog sweep and misses as the ball spins away and beats the batsman. Misses off-stump by inches",
9.5,"Shahid Afridi to Aamer Yamin, no run, opens the bat face and drops it in front of backward point",
9.6,"Shahid Afridi to Aamer Yamin, no run, short and wide, backs away and cuts but Maqsood at backward point makes a brilliant diving save. Slight mix-up in the middle but they get back safely",
10.1,"Wahab Riaz to Narine, 2 runs, full and angling in and Narine superbly picks it up off the toes and flicks it away behind square. Asghar at deep backward square leg runs across and dives to his left, just in front of the ropes, to make a stop. They go upstairs to check and he has done fine there",
10.2,"Wahab Riaz to Narine, FOUR, gets it off the outside edge to third man and Tamim Iqbal fails to stop it entirely. Dived to his right and got his hands to it but the ball rolled away with the momentum after he tried stopping it",
10.3,"Wahab Riaz to Narine, no run, opens him up with a length ball in the corridor of uncertainty and Narine is beaten as he sticks his bat out. All squared up",
10.4,"Wahab Riaz to Narine, OUT, and the entertaining partnership comes to an end. You just got the feeling if nLahore were wresting back the momentum and Wahab has struck. Short of a length ball does the trick as Narine tries to get the front leg out the way and pull it. But not enough room to play the shot convincingly as you can see from the stifled follow-through and deep square leg takes the catch",
10.5,"Wahab Riaz to Aamer Yamin, no run, short of good length, defended off the backfoot",

11.5,"Shahid Afridi to Aamer Yamin, no run, fuller ball, sliding in, misses the clip and hits the batsman on the toe, heading down leg",
11.6,"Shahid Afridi to Aamer Yamin, 1 run",
12.1,"Sammy to Aamer Yamin, OUT, that's self-destruction. Lahore are trying to force the issue and it is not working. This one is short and wide and he tries to slap it away. All he can do it slice it to point where Hafeez takes the catck",
12.2,"Sammy to Yasir Shah, no run",
12.3,"Sammy to Yasir Shah, 1 run, closes the face of his bat as he tries to flick this length ball into the leg side and the ball takes the leading edge and goes wide of point. Only just",

14.1,"Sammy to Sohail Tanvir, FOUR, sees some width outside off and picks up the slower ball early to get in position. Sammy had rolled his fingers over it and it sat up nicely for Tanvir who fetches a pull from outside off and the ball goes between long-on and deep middwicket",
14.2,"Sammy to Sohail Tanvir, 1 run, slower short of a length ball, steers it to third man",
14.3,"Sammy to Yasir Shah, 1 run, short of a length, angling in on off, gets the front leg out of the way and pats it into the leg side",

14.5,"Sammy to Yasir Shah, 1 run, slower ball again, opens the bat face and steers it through cover-point",

15.1,"Hasan Ali to Sohail Tanvir, FOUR, short ball, tries to fetch a pull from outside off and gets a leading edge as the ball files over the third man boundary. Or has it? It beat the third man fielder but just landed in front of the ropes",
15.2,"Hasan Ali to Sohail Tanvir, no run, good length ball on off, blocked",
15.3,"Hasan Ali to Sohail Tanvir, no run, short of a length, tries to go big over the leg side but the angle takes the ball away from him and he cannot make contact",

16.4,"Wahab Riaz to Sohail Tanvir, no run, superb dipping yorker on middle and leg. That looked like a full toss right till the end and Tanvir jams the bat down. Gets an inside edge that goes to the right of the keeper who dives to his right and stops. That was a fantastic yorker",
16.5,"Wahab Riaz to Sohail Tanvir, no run, full, wide, yorker again, Tanvir fails to squeeze it out through the off side as he jams the bat down. Nice mixing up of length from Wahab",
16.6,"Wahab Riaz to Sohail Tanvir, 1 run, goes for the slow, dipping yorker again but fires a full toss that is whipped away between deep midwicket and long-on. What an over from Wahab. Just two off it",
17.1,"Hasan Ali to Sohail Tanvir, SIX, that's a mile into the stands at long-on. Full, wide, and Tanvir fetches it from way outside off. Drags it over long-on and it has sailed comfortably into the bottom-tier. Can Tanvir do something special here? He's striking the ball well here",
17.2,"Hasan Ali to Sohail Tanvir, no run, wide fuller ball, Tanvir cannot make contact as he attempts to squeeze it out. Umpire does not think it is a wide",
17.3,"Hasan Ali to Sohail Tanvir, no run, fuller on off, goes for a drive and bottom-edges it to the keeper. Got that off the toe end",
17.4,"Hasan Ali to Sohail Tanvir, 2 runs, full and wide, driven square of the wicket. There is a deep point in place but they push back for the second by the time h can get around the ball and fire a throw",

18.4,"Wahab Riaz to Yasir Shah, FOUR, short of good length and wide outside off. Yasir flays it with a flat bat through mid-ff and Sammy runs back and puts in a vigorous dive. Could have hurt himself as he landed on his wrist there. The ball goes across the ropes nonetheless",
18.5,"Wahab Riaz to Yasir Shah, SIX, short ball, fetches a pull from outside off and he has got hold of this one nicely. The ball sails comfortably over deep midwicket. And that brings up the fifty of the partnership",

19.2,"Shahid Afridi to Yasir Shah, FOUR, gets down to slog sweep and does not get any elevation as the ball goes along the ground. The fielder running across from deep midwicket slides with his foot forward instead of diving with his arms outstretched and the ball goes past the boundary",
19.3,"Shahid Afridi to Yasir Shah, OUT, advances down the track to slog and misses the ball altogether. Kamran whips the bails off in a flash. That was quick from Afridi and Yasir was beaten by pace. Nice hand, though",

19.5,"Shahid Afridi to Sohail Tanvir, no run, what a catch that is from Sammy! He is not sure though and they have to refer that upstairs. Seems like he has hurt his fingers too slightly. . Slogs it from the crease and Sammy runs in and dives forward at long-on. Seems like he has his fingers underneath it but it is touch and go. Not out is the call. It was not convincing and the umpire, not being 100 percent sure, does not give it",
19.6,"Shahid Afridi to Sohail Tanvir, 1 run, short ball, gets big on him and he responds with a hurried pull as the ball goes through midwicket",
