0.1,"Hasan Ali to Asad Shafiq, 2 runs, fullish ball, comes forward and pushes it uppishly through the covers region for a brace",
0.2,"Hasan Ali to Asad Shafiq, no run, fuller and outside off, punches it crunchily back to the bowler",
0.3,"Hasan Ali to Asad Shafiq, no run, short of a length and skids through, little bit of nibble into the right-hander, defended back to the bowler",
0.4,"Hasan Ali to Asad Shafiq, 1 run, jags back in to the right-hander from the back of a length area again and it is pushed from the crease to mid-on before they take off for a quick single",
0.5,"Hasan Ali to Ahmed Shehzad, no run, short of a length, no movement on this one and it comes on straight just outside off, blocked into the off side",
0.6,"Hasan Ali to Ahmed Shehzad, no run, through the defences, or is it? Hasan gets this one to nibble in sharply again and it beats the inside edge and goes to the wicketkeeper. There is a slight noise and a half appeal for a caught behind, but the umpire is not convinced. Seems like it went off the pad",
1.1,"Mohammad Asghar to Asad Shafiq, OUT, and straight away he gets a wicket. This is brilliantly bowled. What a delivery to start off things. Draws Shafiq out of the crease and the batsman obliges. Comes a good way down the track but picks the wrong line. The ball drifts away from him and dips on him before spinning away to comprehensively beat him. Kamran Akmal does the rest",['Asad Shafiq st †Kamran Akmal b Mohammad Asghar 3 (5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 60.00']
1.2,"Mohammad Asghar to Pietersen, no run, goes for the big sweep and gets hit on the pad. Had the front leg a long way across and the impact was outside off",
1.3,"Mohammad Asghar to Pietersen, 1 run, comes down the track to meet the pitch of this ball before turning it away just to the right of mid-on",
1.4,"Mohammad Asghar to Ahmed Shehzad, no run, loopy and pitched up. Angling in on middle and off and it is bunted into the off side",
1.5,"Mohammad Asghar to Ahmed Shehzad, OUT, holes out to extra cover. Shehzad gives the spinner the charge and tries to loft him down the ground. But he does not account for the sharp turn, the ball is going a long way away from him which means he fails to get on top of it and skews it off the splice of the blade. Sohaib Maqsood settles under it",
1.6,"Mohammad Asghar to Pietersen, 1 run, floated up on middle and spinning away, Pietersen crunches a drive to extra cover. Top over from Asghar",['Ahmed Shehzad c Sohaib Maqsood b Mohammad Asghar 0 (4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00']
2.1,"Shakib Al Hasan to Pietersen, no run, comes down the track and works it to mid-on",
2.2,"Shakib Al Hasan to Pietersen, 1 leg bye, oh, dear. Comes down the track but this one drifts in with the arm and hits him on the pad. Narrowly misses the stumps as it rolls away off the pad towards the fine leg region. He was a long way down so it was always going to make it hard for the lbw to come into play",
2.3,"Shakib Al Hasan to Rossouw, no run, chance at first slip, put down. Rossouw brings out the reverse sweep and skews it off the top edge to Sammy who is moving the wrong way to his left, too late to make amends as he puts a hand to it after stretching as he cannot hold on to it",
2.4,"Shakib Al Hasan to Rossouw, no run, pitched up, defended off the front foot",
2.5,"Shakib Al Hasan to Rossouw, no run, fullish in length again, dabs it into the leg side. No run there",
2.6,"Shakib Al Hasan to Rossouw, no run",
3.1,"Mohammad Asghar to Pietersen, FOUR, turn and bounce but also short and wide. Pietersen slaps it hard off the backfoot past extra cover where the fielder dives but the ball beats him and does into the boundary",
3.2,"Mohammad Asghar to Pietersen, 2 runs, past the diving extra cover fielder again. Short and wide and it is punched firmly off the backfoot, long-off runs across and tidies up",
3.3,"Mohammad Asghar to Pietersen, no run, good length. Tossed up and drifting in before straightening. Pietersen has his feet firmly planted inside as he defends, chops it hard into the turf as he does so",
3.4,"Mohammad Asghar to Pietersen, no run, good length and spinning away outside off, left alone",
3.5,"Mohammad Asghar to Pietersen, no run, shifts back and across to protect the off-stump before smothering the spin and defending this one back towards the bowler",
3.6,"Mohammad Asghar to Pietersen, 3 runs, length ball on off, punched through covers. Two fielders giving it a chase and one of them gets down and manages to pull it back before the ropes",
4.1,"Shakib Al Hasan to Pietersen, no run, goes on with the arm and Pietersen backs away to cut but not enough room and he cannot find the gap in the off side",
4.2,"Shakib Al Hasan to Pietersen, no run, comes down the track and the ball goes off the pad back to the bowler. He was moving across outside off to that one",
4.3,"Shakib Al Hasan to Pietersen, 2 runs, short and wide, cut off the backfoot past the diving cover fielder",
4.4,"Shakib Al Hasan to Pietersen, FOUR, too short and too wide again, the pitch is so slow that he has all the time in the world. Shifts back to use the depth of the crease before laying into a cut shot. Picks the gap through covers perfectly",
4.5,"Shakib Al Hasan to Pietersen, 1 run, shifts back and makes room, does not get hold of all of it as he works it out to long-off",
4.6,"Shakib Al Hasan to Rossouw, 1 run, comes down the track, keeps a bit low and he does not entirely manage to get on top of that one as he nudges it away through the midwicket region",
5.1,"Wahab Riaz to Rossouw, 1 leg bye, good length ball, rushes him with pace and the ball cuts back in to rap him on the thigh guard. Optimistic appeal for lbw but that was missing leg. Height also a factor as it hit him on the flap",
5.2,"Wahab Riaz to Pietersen, no run, short of a length on leg and middle, stays in the crease and whips it away to midwicket",
5.3,"Wahab Riaz to Pietersen, no run, tries to whip it hard through the leg side but cannot beat the midwicket fielder",
5.4,"Wahab Riaz to Pietersen, no run, goes hard as he tries to flay this length ball through the off side but the ball goes on the bounce and drops in front of point",
5.5,"Wahab Riaz to Pietersen, 2 runs, short of good length on the pads, tucked off them to the deep fine leg boundary",
5.6,"Wahab Riaz to Pietersen, 2 runs, could have nearly holed out there. Full and angling away outside off, gets the front leg out of the way to give himself enough room and launches it over the off side. Does not entirely get hold of it and the ball lands short of the deep point fielder running across to his left. Wahab not entirely pleased with that effort",
6.1,"Hasan Ali to Rossouw, no run, length ball on off, punched to the left of the bowler and the ball goes to mid-on",
6.2,"Hasan Ali to Rossouw, FOUR, length on off, opens up a bit and slogs it out to cow corner. No one in the deep",
6.3,"Hasan Ali to Rossouw, FOUR, gets down to scoop and uses the pace on that delivery as he goes down on one knee and lifts it over and behind, gets it well past the short fine leg fielder and into the boundary",
6.4,"Hasan Ali to Rossouw, no run, cutter outside off, tries to flick it away and is deceived completely. Walks into the shot and gets beaten",
6.5,"Hasan Ali to Rossouw, 1 run, just short of Sammy at mid-off. Short of a length on off, moves away to make room before flaying it with a flat bat. Cannot get hold of it and the ball goes on the bounce to the mid-off fielder",
6.6,"Hasan Ali to Pietersen, 2 runs, short ball, sitting up nicely for Pietersen who swivels around and pulls. The ball seems to be going to the square leg boundary but deft footwork from Shakib as he plants the right foot across to stop the ball just in front of the boundary after running across from deep midwicket",
7.1,"Shahid Afridi to Rossouw, no run, fullish and pushed across, gets down to scoop but fails to make proper connection, the ball hardly goes any distance and falls short of the short fine leg fielder running in",
7.2,"Shahid Afridi to Rossouw, no run, driven off the front foot to covers",
7.3,"Shahid Afridi to Rossouw, no run, similar ball, similar shot. Fullish and crunches a drive to covers",
7.4,"Shahid Afridi to Rossouw, no run, and this one is drilled off the front foot to the bowler and Afridi gets down to the right to field it. Afridi nicely building up the pressure as Rossouw is struggling to get going",
7.5,"Shahid Afridi to Rossouw, no run, you could see this coming. He was desperate to get going and comes charging down the trac to go for a big slog. Ends up getting an inside edge that goes to short fine leg",
7.6,"Shahid Afridi to Rossouw, no run, opens the face of his bat as he sees some width being offered up outside off but cannot beat short third man. Terrific over from Afridi. Maiden. Will the dots lead to a dismissal?",
8.1,"Shakib Al Hasan to Pietersen, FOUR, that has split the gap beautifully. Generously flighted outside off and he absolutely lays into a drive that goes wide of extra cover. Long-off darts across but that was hammered and no chance for the fielder",
8.2,"Shakib Al Hasan to Pietersen, 1 run, length on off, cut through cover-point",
8.3,"Shakib Al Hasan to Rossouw, 1 run, fullish length ball outside off, Rossouw shifts back in the crease and turns it away into the on side. Shakib runs across and collects it",
8.4,"Shakib Al Hasan to Pietersen, no run, down the trac kand looking to whip it away to the on side but the drift on this one takes it in to him and he gets rapped on the pads. Was down by a fair distance, so stifled appeal for lbw not given",
8.5,"Shakib Al Hasan to Pietersen, no run, fuller ball, driven back to the bowler",
8.6,"Shakib Al Hasan to Pietersen, 1 run, driven through covers and he will keep the strike",
9.1,"Shahid Afridi to Pietersen, 1 run, turn outside off and some bounce as well, steered off the backfoot square of the wicket",
9.2,"Shahid Afridi to Rossouw, SIX, what a blow that is. Punches this length ball and lifts it over extra cover. Just presents the full face of his bat and the timing on that carries the ball all the way. Holds the pose with the straight bat as he finishes the shot",
9.3,"Shahid Afridi to Rossouw, no run",
9.4,"Shahid Afridi to Rossouw, 1 run, gets down to sweep early but it is not full enough. On a length and spinning in and he gets it off the top edge as the ball lands in front of deep backward square leg",
9.5,"Shahid Afridi to Pietersen, 4 leg byes, comes down the track and looks to clip it away through the leg side but he has got that off the pad. Drifting in with the arm and raps him on the pad and goes to the fine leg boundary. Almost fell off as he played that one",
9.6,"Shahid Afridi to Pietersen, no run, driven but cannot find the gap in the covers region",
10.1,"Mohammad Asghar to Rossouw, FOUR, short of a length, middle and leg, swivels around and pulls to deep midwicket",
10.2,"Mohammad Asghar to Rossouw, 1 run, comes down the track and looks to slog over the leg side but ends up dragging it behind square off the inside part of the blade",
10.3,"Mohammad Asghar to Pietersen, 1 leg bye, drifting in with the arm and strikes him on the pad as he misses the big slog. Pitching outside leg and lots of turn and it probably saved him there",
10.4,"Mohammad Asghar to Rossouw, 2 runs, clipped off the pads to deep midwicket, long-on runs forward and picks it up. It gives them enough time to complete two runs",
10.5,"Mohammad Asghar to Rossouw, no run, goes for a reverse paddle sweep and ends up missing and getting hit on the pads",
10.6,"Mohammad Asghar to Rossouw, 1 run, slog sweep, top edge, luckily for Rossouw, it lands short of deep midwicket running across and is fielded in front of the deep square leg boundary",

11.4,"Wahab Riaz to Rossouw, 1 run, short of a length, tries to pull it away but it does not sit up to his liking and Rososuw ends up dragging it down to long-on",
11.5,"Wahab Riaz to Pietersen, no run, good length, angling away outside off, it's the cutter and spins away like an orthodox left-arm spinner's delivery as it cuts off the seam after landing and misses the flashing blade of KP who was looking to heave it away",
11.6,"Wahab Riaz to Pietersen, 1 run, back of a length on off, cramps him for room and it is worked to sweeper cover",
12.1,"Shahid Afridi to Pietersen, 1 leg bye, down the leg side, goes for a slog sweep. Misses and wears it on the pad before the ball rolls away to fine leg",
12.2,"Shahid Afridi to Rossouw, 2 runs, tries to pull but is through with the shot a tad early and gets it off the glove to the fine leg region",

13.1,"Shakib Al Hasan to Pietersen, 1 run, tucked into the leg side",
13.2,"Shakib Al Hasan to Rossouw, SIX, short ball, rocks back and lays into a pull shot and the ball clears the cow corner boundary comfortably. Sat up nicely and that was pummelled flat",

13.4,"Shakib Al Hasan to Pietersen, 1 leg bye, drifting in on the pads with the arm, misses the attempted flick and kisses the pad of Pietersen as the ball goes down to fine leg",
13.5,"Shakib Al Hasan to Rossouw, OUT, steps out of the crease and slogs again but this time he does not get hold of it entirely. It was wide outside off, meaning he had to drag it from wide of his reach. Gives it a good thump but not good enough to clear the man running across from long-on",
13.6,"Shakib Al Hasan to Mohammad Nawaz, 1 run, tries to flick and gets a leading edge that goes to cover",['RR Rossouw c Mohammad Asghar b Shakib Al Hasan 38 (34b 3x4 2x6) SR: 111.76']

14.2,"Shahid Afridi to Pietersen, 1 run, goes for a reverse sweep but gets an inside edge to the pad and the ball goes to short third man. Appeal from Afridi, turned down",
14.3,"Shahid Afridi to Mohammad Nawaz, 2 runs, chance at deep midwicket, not taken. Oh, dear! Hafeez and Hasan Ali converge on the ball and neither of them takes it. It was a slog sweep and he skied it, did not get the elevation desired and the ball lands in the deep midwicket region. Both fielders end up looking at each other",
14.4,"Shahid Afridi to Mohammad Nawaz, 1 run",
14.5,"Shahid Afridi to Pietersen, 1 run, reverse sweep. Gets it on the back leg but the impact is outside off. Afridi's screaming is lungs out in appeal but it is not given. They run as the ball goes to short third man and he throws at the striker's end. Direct hit. Batsman is inside, so the appeal for run out is turned down as well",
14.6,"Shahid Afridi to Mohammad Nawaz, no run",
15.1,"Mohammad Asghar to Pietersen, OUT, Hasan Ali takes the catch this time, in front of the long-on boundary. Smart catch as he gets down to his front. Pietersen was trying to loft it as the ball slides in with arm but does not middle it. Looks at the toe end of the bat, suggesting the ball went off there",
15.2,"Mohammad Asghar to Mohammad Nawaz, 2 runs, length ball outside off, not much turn, whipped off the pads to the vacant gaps in the midwicket region and they come back for a sharp two",
15.3,"Mohammad Asghar to Mohammad Nawaz, 1 run, tries to slog and does not get hold of it, goes along the ground to long-on",
15.4,"Mohammad Asghar to Sarfraz Ahmed, FOUR, fuller ball, uses the angle and sweeps behind square as the ball goes to the deep backward square leg boundary",['KP Pietersen c Hasan Ali b Mohammad Asghar 41 (43b 4x4 0x6) SR: 95.34']
15.5,"Mohammad Asghar to Sarfraz Ahmed, 1 run, loopy ball, drifting in in middle and spinning away, drops it into the off side off the front foot and takes off for a quick single",
15.6,"Mohammad Asghar to Mohammad Nawaz, SIX, length ball outside off, enough width on offer and he picked up the length early, flays it over long-on and it comfortably gets over the fielder leaping back with outstretched hands",
16.1,"Hasan Ali to Sarfraz Ahmed, no run, comes down the track to this short of a length ball and tries to heave it away through the leg side with an angled bat. But the ball is angled in and it cramps him for room and he cannot make contact",

16.3,"Hasan Ali to Sarfraz Ahmed, 1 run, short of a length and cutting back in slightly from outside off, stays in the crease and opens the bat face to steer it to third man",
16.4,"Hasan Ali to Mohammad Nawaz, no run, stays in the crease and goes after this wide delivery outside off without any feet and gets comprehensively beaten as the angle takes the ball away from him",
16.5,"Hasan Ali to Mohammad Nawaz, 3 runs, full, wide, drills a drive through extra cover, to the right of Afridi and what a save from the not-so-young man. Runs back with all committment and puts in a full-length dive to forcefully pull it back. A catch was not taken off his bowling earlier on and he is now setting an example",
16.6,"Hasan Ali to Sarfraz Ahmed, 1 run, drilled down to long-on for a single",
17.1,"Wahab Riaz to Sarfraz Ahmed, 1 run, OUT, short and wide, cuts off the backfoot to deep point. Sweeper cover runs across and collects it and they push for the second. Good throw needed and it comes at the keeper's end. Not the best of throws. Kamran does well to gather the ball and throw on to the stumps and he is short of the crease. Credit to the keeper there for collecting a slightly wayward throw",
17.2,"Wahab Riaz to Mahmudullah, no run, stays leg side of the ball to make room and flays this short of a length ball to backward point",
17.3,"Wahab Riaz to Mahmudullah, OUT, comes down the track and there is extra pace and bounce on that delivery. Gets big on him and he is a long way away from the ball as well so he has to fetch the pull. Cannot find the middle of the bat. Chops it on to the stumps off the bottom part of the blade and Mahmudullah's short stint does not yield any runs",
17.4,"Wahab Riaz to Hasan Khan, no run, short of a length on the stumps, jumps up to ride the bounce and moves across to protect off-stump as he does so. Nudges to the leg side",
17.5,"Wahab Riaz to Hasan Khan, 1 run, short of a length, drops it into the off side off the backfoot and sets off for a quick single",['Sarfraz Ahmed run out 8 (7b 1x4 0x6) SR: 114.28']
17.6,"Wahab Riaz to Mohammad Nawaz, 1 run, slower length ball outside off, taps from the crease with a flat bat and chops it towards point",
18.1,"Hasan Ali to Mohammad Nawaz, OUT, brilliant caught and bowled by Hasan. Length ball, Nawaz was looking to slog it and ends up skying it. Can't get any sort of distance on it. Hasan settles under it nicely. The striker collides into him as he is completing the run and Hasan is trying to get in line of the ball. But that does not deter him as he judges it to perfection and pouches a smart catch. Took a similar one yesterday",['Mahmudullah b Wahab Riaz 0 (2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00']
18.2,"Hasan Ali to Hasan Khan, 1 run, fuller ball, gets the front leg out of the way and crunches a drive but straight to the fielder at extra cover",
18.3,"Hasan Ali to Zulfiqar Babar, OUT, down the throat of Wahab at deep square leg. Goes for the slog and skies it again. Cannot clear the long boundary at the square leg region and Wahab takes the catch quite comfortably. Another well-judged catch",
18.4,"Hasan Ali to Hasan Khan, 1 run, short of a length, drags it away to long-on with a flat bat and they take a quick single",

19.1,"Wahab Riaz to Umar Gul, 1 run, short of a length, tries to whip it away, gets into a bit of a tangle and I think it has gone off the glove into the leg side. Off the forearm, as replays tell us",['Mohammad Nawaz (3) c & b Hasan Ali 18 (12b 0x4 1x6) SR: 150.00']
19.2,"Wahab Riaz to Hasan Khan, no run, tries to stay in the crease and open the bat face to run it down to third man. But the bounce is steep and it is too close so he gets beaten for room",
19.3,"Wahab Riaz to Hasan Khan, 1 run, short of a length, drops it in front of point",
19.4,"Wahab Riaz to Umar Gul, OUT, short of a length and tries to pull the ball, Gets a mild top-edge that barely goes up. Wahab runs forward on the follow-through and snaffles it. Seems like Gul isn't feeling too good after copping that blow on the forearm, grimaces as he walks off",['Zulfiqar Babar c Wahab Riaz b Hasan Ali 0 (1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00']
19.5,"Wahab Riaz to Mills, 1 run, short ball, gets a top-edge on the pull and the ball goes to backward square and drops short of Afridi running across from fine leg",
19.6,"Wahab Riaz to Hasan Khan, 1 run, OUT, short ball, drags a pull from outside off to midwicket. They come charging back for the second. Throw fired at the keeper's end by the fielder running across from long-on and Kamran takes his time to throw the ball onto the stumps. Batsman well short",
