Gets beaten as he sticks his bat out in the channel outside off and gets beaten. Keeper does the rest",['Tamim Iqbal st †Sarfraz Ahmed b Mahmudullah 7 (13b 0x4 0x6) SR: 53.84']

He picks up the ball and throws it to Sarfaraz. And the keeper, for some sane reason, does not try to break the stumps. Had he tried to flick it back and hit the stumps, the batsman would have been well short. Think that is what Pietersen is telling his captain",
7.3,"Mills to Kamran Akmal, 1 run, worked away through square leg",
7.4,"Mills to Samuels, OUT, what a catch! Samuels has another disappointing night. Amin was the substitute fielder, fielding close-in at forward short leg. Samuels tries to fend this short of a length ball off the hips. It is angled in on the body and he tries to flick it away, it hits the splice and seems to be flying over the forward short leg fielder but Yamin jumps up and back in a jiffy. Flew like a spark and takes it single-handed. Electric!",

8.1,"Mohammad Nawaz to Kamran Akmal, OUT, appeal for lbw and given. Kamran gets down to sweep and the ball is not full enough to sweep. It is on a length and he misses the ball, gets hit on the pad. Seems to be hitting in front of middle and leg. Kamran does not seem happy for some reason as he trudges off. Wicket off the first ball for Nawaz. He got a glove on that, actually",

9.3,"Mahmudullah to Sammy, OUT, and what does he do! Holes out to long-off first ball. Tries to loft the spinner down the ground but he only gets the elevation, not the distance. Probably went off the bottom part of the bat and Nawaz runs to his right from long-off to snaffle it in front of the straight boundary. Irresponsible shot from the captain, and Sammy goes right back from where he came",
9.4,"Mahmudullah to Shahid Afridi, 1 run, oh my, oh my! Nearly had the hat-trick. What drama! Afridi comes down the track to this full toss and does not get hold of the shot as he lofts it over mid-off. Long-off comes running in and dives forward and the ball falls inches, just inches in front of him. Got to wonder, why would you play that kind of a shot off a hat-trick ball",

10.4,"Mohammad Nawaz to Mohammad Hafeez, FOUR, gets it just over the fielder at midwicket. Mahmudullah it is. Short ball and it is pulled off the backfoot, clips the fingers of Mahmudullah as the ball goes to the boundary. Dropped chance but a very tough one",

He is nowhere near this ball outside off as he was staying legside of it. Swings wildly and gets an outside edge for his troubles that his held comfortably by the wicketkeeper",
