0.3,"Mohammad Irfan to Gayle, OUT, caught at the third man boundary and the danger man's gone. Looks to heave a length ball on off stump over the leg side but ends up with a thick outside edge that goes so very high in the air. Mohammad Sami gets under it, making sure to keep his eyes on the ball, and moving with it as it swirls in the air and finally takes it with both hands. Excellent technique",['CH Gayle c Mohammad Sami b Mohammad Irfan 2 (3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 66.66']
0.4,"Mohammad Irfan to Babar Azam, no run, oooh, that's close. A direct hit from point nearly catches Babar short. He gets up off his feet to ride the bounce of this short delivery outside off, but then looks for a single when there isn't one.

2.1,"Mohammad Irfan to Sangakkara, OUT, he's yorked him. Sanga has no answer to this top-notch delivery. Seriously, a ball coming down from around 10 feet in the air, looking to singe your toes? Unplayable. Goes under the bat, beat him for pace and makes him look like an amateur",
