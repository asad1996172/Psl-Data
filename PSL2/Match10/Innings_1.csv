Ball,Commentary,Wicket
0.1,"Imad Wasim to Smith, 1 run, stays back and flicks a quicker one, skidding in on leg stump, through midwicket",
0.2,"Imad Wasim to Billings, OUT, pins him in front, Billings is basically beaten for pace by Imad's arm ball. What a way to start for Karachi! Pitches it on a good length and benefits from the ball skidding on, cramping the batsman for room, and considering he starts playing down the wrong line, he is done in.",['SW Billings lbw b Imad Wasim 0 (1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00']
0.3,"Imad Wasim to Haddin, no run, another quick delivery coming into the right-hander, at off stump, Haddin just about keeps it out",
0.4,"Imad Wasim to Haddin, no run, rushes down the track and hacks the full delivery through midwicket",
0.5,"Imad Wasim to Haddin, no run, goes wider of the crease and seeing that Haddin makes some room. The good length ball ends up outside leg stump, and yet it is played with a straight bat into the off side",
0.6,"Imad Wasim to Haddin, FOUR, there's a little bit of cat and mouse going on already. Haddin's moving outside leg may have tempted Imad to bowl this wide of off stump, but the batsman simply stands, winds up and goes bang over midwicket",
1.1,"Mohammad Amir to Smith, 1 run, shortish and outside off, Smith works it off his hips through midwicket",
1.2,"Mohammad Amir to Haddin, no run, full and outside off, Haddin goes after it, looking for a boundary down the ground. Comes up with a whole lot of nothing",
1.3,"Mohammad Amir to Haddin, 1 run, waits on the back foot now, knowing after that big hoick and miss the bowler will adjust his length. Runs it off the open face to third man",
1.4,"Mohammad Amir to Smith, no run, looks to slog across the line of a ball angled across him and gets an inside edge towards midwicket.",
1.5,"Mohammad Amir to Smith, no run, seems to come back in after pitching on middle and leg and Smith plays all across it, beaten for pace and the movement. Flick and miss",
1.6,"Mohammad Amir to Smith, no run, finishes the over excellently. Smith wafts at a fuller delivery outside off, looking to smash it across the line again, and is beaten on the inside edge",
2.1,"Imad Wasim to Haddin, no run, strikes it sweetly into the covers, but Azam puts in a diving save. Funny how balls on leg stump, flat and quick still end up there",
2.2,"Imad Wasim to Haddin, 1 run, full and into middle and leg, Haddin swings it to mid-on",
2.3,"Imad Wasim to Smith, no run, leaps back away from the line of a flat delivery outside off and cuts to cover",
2.4,"Imad Wasim to Smith, 1 run, allows the dart to come to him on leg stump and flicks it past midwicket",
2.5,"Imad Wasim to Haddin, no run, goes for the slog sweep, seeing a little more flight on this 98 kph delivery on middle and leg. Ends up missing it altogether",
2.6,"Imad Wasim to Haddin, OUT, mistimes it, and he's gone! Imad makes it known to everyone at the ground, having tossed up a delivery onto middle and leg and despite Haddin coming down the track, he can gain little advantage. Chips a simple catch back to the bowler. Well, they end up simple after you feel the ball on your thigh and clutch at it to make sure it doens't drop to the ground. What a spell this is turning out to be",
3.1,"Usman Khan to Smith, 1 run, excellent fielding at short fine leg. Bhatti, the new man in. This could well have been a boundary. Usman starts his spell with a short delivery down leg and Smith just tickles it around the corner. But Bhatti throws himself to his right and keeps it to a single",['BJ Haddin c & b Imad Wasim 6 (10b 1x4 0x6) SR: 60.00']
3.2,"Usman Khan to Misbah-ul-Haq, no run, now his line shifts way outside off, and Misbah simply shoulders arms",
3.3,"Usman Khan to Misbah-ul-Haq, 1 run, fuller delivery outside off, drives towards mid-off",
3.4,"Usman Khan to Smith, no run, tries to short-arm pull a back of a length delivery from leg stump, but it skids into him too quickly to make any connection",
3.5,"Usman Khan to Smith, 1 run, still too cramped to get the big shot away. Khan bowls short and outside leg, his left-armer's angle through makes it go across the right-hander and Smith is hitting against that angle. The ball skidding doesn't help his cause either",
3.6,"Usman Khan to Misbah-ul-Haq, 1 run, nudges off his thigh pad behind square leg to regain the strike for the next over",
4.1,"Imad Wasim to Misbah-ul-Haq, 1 run, tries to put off the left-arm spinner with an early movement away towards the leg side, but then he's back in line with the stumps to defend a good length ball into the covers",
4.2,"Imad Wasim to Smith, SIX, is long-on in play, it's Pollard moving back, right to the edge of the boundary, but it lobs over him. Smith gets a good chunk on this length ball outside off and belts it down the ground",
4.3,"Imad Wasim to Smith, no run, flatter, quicker, on off stump, defends",
4.4,"Imad Wasim to Smith, 1 run, rocks back to pull and this rapid delivery on middle and leg is hit to midwicket",
4.5,"Imad Wasim to Misbah-ul-Haq, no run, misses the sweep - that ball was there for the shot, length, and gave him enough room to swing the arms- but it goes right over off stump into the wicketkeeper's gloves.",
4.6,"Imad Wasim to Misbah-ul-Haq, no run, more slog sweeps, this time it's a worse shot because the length is too full and it's cramping him for a free swing of the arms. Inside edge on the pad",
5.1,"Kashif Bhatti to Smith, SIX, that's onto the roof! Small ground, yes, but it doesn't need to be for Smith to hit sixes. Picks an overpitched delivery on off stump, comes forward and smashes it over long-on",
5.2,"Kashif Bhatti to Smith, 1 run, shortish and outside off, cut to deep point",
5.3,"Kashif Bhatti to Misbah-ul-Haq, no run, takes a length ball and drives to cover",
5.4,"Kashif Bhatti to Misbah-ul-Haq, no run, defends a good length ball with an open face, but point is quick enough to stop any thought of a single",
5.5,"Kashif Bhatti to Misbah-ul-Haq, 1 run, does well there the bowler, pulling his length back seeing Misbah charging at him. The batsman then dabs it into the covers and takes a single",
5.6,"Kashif Bhatti to Smith, 2 runs, this is a mis-hit and deep cover drops him. Usman Khan the culprit. There is a little more turn off this delivery, Smith swings against it and gets a leading edge. The fielder rushes in too quickly, and therefore has to leap back at the last minute, his hands over his head to try and tack the catch. Poor effort",
6.1,"Usama Mir to Misbah-ul-Haq, 1 run, lots of spin, so much that Misbah nearly loses his balance while trying to cut",
6.2,"Usama Mir to Smith, 1 run, belts it to long-off, it's not often that he plays with the turn into the off side, but it's not like he loses any power",
6.3,"Usama Mir to Misbah-ul-Haq, no run, oooh, turning square. This is a good length ball that makes Misbah reach out to try and block and his outside edge is beaten by a massive margin.",
6.4,"Usama Mir to Misbah-ul-Haq, no run, attempts to come down the track, but the bowler fires it in short and wide, Misbah slices it to point",
6.5,"Usama Mir to Misbah-ul-Haq, no run, tries a lap sweep, but the slower delivery trumps him. He doesn't have the pace to work with and in trying ot make the pace himself, he overhits and misses",
6.6,"Usama Mir to Misbah-ul-Haq, no run, shortish and outside off, slices it to short third man. Top first over from Usama Mir. Only two runs.",
7.1,"Kashif Bhatti to Smith, no run, basically yorks him, outside leg and Smith manages to dig it out.",
7.2,"Kashif Bhatti to Smith, SIX, full toss on middle and leg, swipes hard and pulls it long and clean over midwicket",
7.3,"Kashif Bhatti to Smith, no run, wide outside off, tries to cut and gets beaten",
7.4,"Kashif Bhatti to Smith, 1 run, touch wider again and spinning away, cut to sweeper cover",
7.5,"Kashif Bhatti to Misbah-ul-Haq, SIX, comes down the track and there is a lot of room outside off which gives him the chance to free his arms and crash it straight down the ground for a big straight six",
7.6,"Kashif Bhatti to Misbah-ul-Haq, 1 run, comes down the track and goes over mid-off as he tries to clear the in-field",
8.1,"Usama Mir to Misbah-ul-Haq, no run, gets down to reverse sweep very early, telegraphs his intent and the bowler lands it on a fullish length and the ball spins sharply to strike him on the pad but the impact was probably outside off",
8.2,"Usama Mir to Misbah-ul-Haq, 1 run, shuffles across and works it to short third man",
8.3,"Usama Mir to Smith, OUT, length ball on off stump, tries to pull but there is not enough room and he gets cramped as he skews it off the top edge towards short fine leg. Wicketkeeper runs back and snaffles it",
8.4,"Usama Mir to Misbah-ul-Haq, no run, fuller ball on middle and leg, bends forward and blocks into the off side",
8.5,"Usama Mir to Misbah-ul-Haq, 2 runs, short of a length on middle and leg and spinning away sharply, pulled away off the backfoot between deep midwicket and long-on and the call is for two straight away and they take it comfortably",['DR Smith c †Sangakkara b Usama Mir 29 (22b 0x4 3x6) SR: 131.81']
8.6,"Usama Mir to Misbah-ul-Haq, no run, short of a length ball on off, spinning away, cut out to deep point",
9.1,"Mohammad Amir to Watson, FOUR, plays it beautifully. He loves pace on the ball and Amir provides a lot of it with width as well. Watson knows third man is up and so he simply places it past his right and to the boundary",
9.2,"Mohammad Amir to Watson, 1 run, now for his power, taking a length ball outside off and smacking it down to long-off",
9.3,"Mohammad Amir to Misbah-ul-Haq, 1 run, slogs looking for the leg side, but somehow ends up sending a back of a length ball, well outside leg, to third man of all places",
9.4,"Mohammad Amir to Watson, 1 run, looks for the yorker, bowls cross-seam as well, Watson tries a flick and mistimes the ball to deep square leg",
9.5,"Mohammad Amir to Misbah-ul-Haq, no run, big sound as the ball passes bat, but umpire Illingworth knows that's bat hitting ground. Misbah tries to flay a full and wide delivery past point but fails to do so",
9.6,"Mohammad Amir to Misbah-ul-Haq, no run, full, fast and straight, Misbah plants his back leg outside off and tries to swing it away. Beaten. Watson tries to pinch a leg bye, but Misbah knows it is the last ball of the over and he doesn't want the strike in the form he is in. Sends his partner back",
10.1,"Usama Mir to Watson, 1 leg bye, a lot slower through the air is Mir, and Watson, going for a lap sweep, gets a little deflection into the off side.",
10.2,"Usama Mir to Misbah-ul-Haq, OUT, spreads his arms and takes in the glory. Misbah is a magnificent player of spin and Mir has done him in by bowling it slowly and by concentrating on making the ball turn. Tossed up delivery, draws the batsman out of his crease, he goes for a big hoick, mistimes the shot and ends up chipping a catch to long-on running in",
10.3,"Usama Mir to Watson, no run, looks for a sweep as Mir tosses the ball up and drifts it into middle and leg. Fails to make a connection",
10.4,"Usama Mir to Watson, no run, now this one, pushed through outside off, turns massively to beat the cut shot",
10.5,"Usama Mir to Watson, FOUR, smacks across the line through the straight midwicket boundary. This is pure power. And Islamabad need a lot more of this, even if it doesn't look especially pretty",['Misbah-ul-Haq c Babar Azam b Usama Mir 16 (25b 0x4 1x6) SR: 64.00']
10.6,"Usama Mir to Watson, 1 run, pushes a shortish delivery outside off through point",
11.1,"Mohammad Amir to Watson, no run, this is the slower ball, moving across the right-hander, Watson sets up for the slog and misses again",
11.2,"Mohammad Amir to Watson, SIX, pulls it over the long leg boundary. For a second it seems like he is beaten for pace as Amir goes for a bouncer on middle and leg and makes it climb up towards the batsman's throat. But Watson swivels on the back foot and powers it away",
11.3,"Mohammad Amir to Watson, SIX, it's length and it disappears. Watson plants his front leg down the line and simply flicks the ball on his pads away over the long leg boundary.",
11.4,"Mohammad Amir to Watson, 1 run, looks for the wide yorker and Watson muscles it down to long-on",
11.5,"Mohammad Amir to Imran Khalid, 1 run, full toss on middle, Imran swings blind and misses with bat, but does get a painful blow to the body. Can't bother about that right now, he has to get across to the other end and put Watson on strike",
11.6,"Mohammad Amir to Watson, 1 run, looks for the yorker outside off, Watson inside-edges a biff to long-on",
12.1,"Usman Khan to Watson, 1 run, OUT, goes for the blockhole, finds it and Watson can only drill it down the ground for a single. Oh wait, they're coming back for the second. This is going to be tight. The throw is a bit wide. Sanga has a lot of work to do, collects it cleanly and then dives headlong onto the stumps and Watson's gone",
12.2,"Usman Khan to Asif Ali, FOUR, oooh, Sanga's in the spotlight again, but this time he can't quite pull it off. Has to leap up to try and take the outside edge but it's too thick. Lobs off his glove and to the boundary. Asif slogs at a length ball and is lucky",
12.3,"Usman Khan to Asif Ali, 1 run, OUT, in looking for bonus runs, Islamabad are losing a few wickets. Asif belts a length ball to the midwicket boundary, but he can't clear it. Malik is down there, right on the edge, doing well to keep the ball in play and then choosing the right end - the bowler's - to effect the run out",
12.4,"Usman Khan to Asif Ali, OUT, edged and taken. This is full, and just outside off, Asif looks to smoke it over midwicket but only ends up feathering it through to Sangakkara. Everything going wrong for Islamabad",
12.5,"Usman Khan to Shadab Khan, 1 run, ping into the blockhole and Shadab can only squeeze it towards point",['SR Watson run out 26 (14b 2x4 2x6) SR: 185.71']
12.6,"Usman Khan to Mohammad Sami, 1 run, OUT, full and straight, Sami launches it down to long-off, they look for a second run, off the last ball of the over, that's fine, and Pollard's rocket throw catches him short at the keeper's end",
