3.3,"Rumman Raees to Babar Azam, 1 run, that was down the leg side, would have been called a wide if he had mot made contact. Tries to whip it away and inside-edges it to the pad before the ball rolls away towards square leg",
3.4,"Rumman Raees to Gayle, 1 run, dipping yorker length ball, almost a yorker and Gayle squirts it off the inside edge behind square as the ball goes to fine leg. It was the back-of-the-hand slower one and Gayle did not pick the drop in pace",

4.2,"Mohammad Irfan to Gayle, SIX, there's the first one from Gayle. Full and in the slot. Just swings his bat and launches it over long-on after fetching from just outside off. Did not try to hit it hard at all",

4.4,"Mohammad Irfan to Gayle, no run, full toss, angling in, closes the face of his bat early and skews it off the leading edge to mid-off where the ball drops just short of the fielder there. Just short, though",
4.5,"Mohammad Irfan to Gayle, 2 runs, tries to launch this one straight down the ground but all he can do is chip it over the region between mid-off and extra cover. The ball drops in no man's land, just eluded two fielders",
4.6,"Mohammad Irfan to Gayle, FOUR, fuller ball, nearly a yorker and Gayle has drilled it straight down the ground. Sami runs to his right from long-on, slides across and pulls it back just in front of the boundary. They go upstairs to check if he has done fine there. Touch and go and given a four.

5.1,"Saeed Ajmal to Babar Azam, 1 run, turned away to square leg",
5.2,"Saeed Ajmal to Gayle, SIX, that's the best of the lot. Hit with an air of authority. He actually wanted to thump this one and does it really well after stepping down the track and getting to the pitch of it. Over long-on and into the stands",
5.3,"Saeed Ajmal to Gayle, SIX, fuller and outside off, as big as the last one if not bigger. Drags a slog sweep from outside off and such is the power of the man. Sails well into the stands",

5.6,"Saeed Ajmal to Gayle, OUT, highly entertaining over comes to an end with Gayle perishing. Ajmal has the last laugh but what a start. Gayle showing the first glimpses this PSL of what he's capable of. Comes down the track and tries to heave it over the leg side. But the width outside off means he has to fetch it and he does not do a good job of it. Skews it off the leading edge to Irfan at short third man",['CH Gayle c Mohammad Irfan b Saeed Ajmal 44 (17b 2x4 5x6) SR: 258.82']

7.2,"Saeed Ajmal to Sangakkara, 1 run, fuller outside off, driven through covers",
7.3,"Saeed Ajmal to Babar Azam, 1 run, short ball, rocks back and pulls. Man at deep midwicket, and he will cut it off",

8.3,"Shadab Khan to Sangakkara, OUT, fails to clear long-on. It was pitched up and angled away outside off. Sangakkara tries to launch it but it goes flat and hard straight into the hands of the fielder stationed there. Sangakkara is furious with himself, whips the air with his blade as he walks off. Credit to the bowler for enticing the shot by floating it up",

8.5,"Shadab Khan to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, short of good length and whipped away to long leg",
8.6,"Shadab Khan to Babar Azam, FOUR, tries to entice the drive by floating it up and the batsman comes forward and obliges.

10.5,"Shadab Khan to Shoaib Malik, OUT, can't understand the hurry. Malik stays in the crease this time and looks to slog it. But it is well outside off and he gets a top edge. Haddin settles under it",
10.6,"Shadab Khan to Babar Azam, OUT, nails a perfect googly that sees the back of Azam. That is the ball of the night and could be a candidate for the ball of the tournament. Azam plays down the wrong line as he expects it to turn like a traditional legbreak would do. It was on a length and spins it to breach his defence take out his stumps",

14.2,"Rumman Raees to Pollard, 2 runs, fuller ball, driven hard to long-on and they push back for the second. Raees fails to collect the throw. Sami fumbles but recovers and fires a good throw. Had the bowler collected it and taken out the stumps, he could have been gone",
