3.2,"Usman Khan to Duckett, no run, slightly short of a length, tries to pull it away but it does not come at the pace he would have liked. Does not sit up as much either and he struggles with the timing as he ends up dragging it towards mid-on on the bounce",

4.3,"Sohail Khan to Duckett, OUT, and just when it seemed like he was getting some momentum going, he has picked out mid-on. And it is Pollard, he does not drop those. Fullish and Duckett was looking to clip it away. Fails to keep it along the ground, sends it to the right of Pollard who dives and snaffles it. It was the back-of-the-hand legcutter, actually, so the lack of pace probably meant he could not keep it down",['BM Duckett c Pollard b Sohail Khan 16 (13b 3x4 0x6) SR: 123.07']
4.4,"Sohail Khan to Hussain Talat, 1 run, drops it in front of point with soft hands and calls immediately for a single. Non-striker responds well and makes the crease even as the point fielder's throw at the keeper's end misses the stumps",

7.4,"Imad Wasim to Hussain Talat, 1 run, pitched up ball outside off, drilled down to long-off",
7.5,"Imad Wasim to Smith, FOUR, short of good length. There is no turn at all, so bowling at that length is not helping. Smith rocks back and picks the gap through deep midwicket as he lays into a pull shot",
7.6,"Imad Wasim to Smith, OUT, there was never a run there, it seemed like. Very good fielding sees the back of Talat. It was pushed wide of the bowler, to covers, and Smith called for the run. The bowler runs to his left and throws it to Sangakkara who does the rest",

9.2,"Sohail Khan to Watson, no run, there's the first signs of aggression. Shorter ball and Watson was looking to pull it. But it is a back-of-the-hand legcutter, although it spins like an off-break and comes into Watson cramping him for room. Misses",
9.3,"Sohail Khan to Watson, OUT, you could see this coming. There had to be some sense of urgency shown halfway through the 10th over. And it has fetched a wicket for Islamabad.

10.3,"Usama Mir to Haddin, 2 runs, tries to do the same over the off side this time as he launches it but does not get hold of it. The ball lands just away from the extra cver fielder running back",
10.4,"Usama Mir to Haddin, 1 run, too full on off, pushes it down to long-on",
10.5,"Usama Mir to Smith, SIX, Smith shows Haddin how it's done. Right on top of it and it is almost an effortless shot. Pitched up outside off and just about enough room outside off. Smith launches it over long-off with exquisite timing",
10.6,"Usama Mir to Smith, no run, flat and short, drifting down leg, Smith tries to pull it fine but cannot beat short fine leg. Got away with that one did the bowler",
11.1,"Usman Khan to Haddin, 1 run, opens the face of his bat to run it down to third man but cannot get it square enough, perhaps because of the lack of room, and the ball goes on the bouncer to the wicketkeeper",

13.1,"Usman Khan to Haddin, OUT, Haddin has picked out Kieron Pollard. Haddin was looking to launch this fuller ball over long-on, just that it was wide outside off which meant he had to fetch it and drag it from all the way there. And the cow corner is a long boundary. Pollard runs to his right to snaffle it",
13.2,"Usman Khan to Smith, OUT, there's no stopping Pollard. Tell you what, it was not as easy as he made it seem. Smith tries to do what Haddin did earlier and it seems like this is a clean shot. The ball was full again but unlike the previous one, it is coming into Smith, so you would think he has made better connection. Well, he has. Just not high enough for Pollard to watch it sail as he runs to his right and simply sticks his right hand out to pluck it out of nowhere, just like that",
13.3,"Usman Khan to Misbah-ul-Haq, 2 runs, fuller ball, drills it straight down the ground and long-off, running to his right, gets down in time to stop the ball in front of the boundary as he pushes it back",['BJ Haddin c Pollard b Usman Khan 20 (12b 0x4 1x6) SR: 166.66']

14.4,"Mohammad Amir to Shadab Khan, OUT, oh, what a shot! Great improvisation, but unfortunately for him, he has holed out to fine leg. Moves away towards off and uses the pace on the delivery as he tried to scoop it. Malik runs in and pouches it",
