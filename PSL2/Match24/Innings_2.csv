1.1,"Mohammad Asghar to van Wyk, no run, starts off with a full non-turning ball, misses the sweep, hit on the front pad outside the line of off I think. He weathers the lbw appeal",
1.2,"Mohammad Asghar to van Wyk, no run, full on middle, pushed to midwicket",
1.3,"Mohammad Asghar to van Wyk, OUT, short fine leg swoops down on the ball and nails a direct hit. Excellent work from Hasan, catches Van Wyk short. The batsman uses his feet, attempts a flick, and inside-edges the ball to Hasan. Van Wyk eyes a risky single but it sent back by Shehzad. He can't make it in time",['MN van Wyk run out 1 (7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 14.28']

2.2,"Hasan Ali to Ahmed Shehzad, 1 run, slower short ball outside off, might have been a cutter, slashes early in the air to the left of backward point. Yes, this offcutter gripped in the surface",
2.3,"Hasan Ali to Anamul Haque, no run, that's a gem! Good length, angled in, and cuts away viciously past the outside edge. Unplayable",
2.4,"Hasan Ali to Anamul Haque, no run, Sammy drops a catch at slip! Pitched up and outside off, Shehzad reaches out for a drive, plays away from the body, and nicks it behind. The ball hits Sammy's chest and goes down. It just flew to slip. Sammy was late to react",

2.6,"Hasan Ali to Anamul Haque, 1 run, short on off, hits the splice of the bat, the ball rolls to mid-on",
3.1,"Mohammad Asghar to Anamul Haque, OUT, The reprieve costs Peshawar just one run. Anamul holes out to long-off. Jordan is a quality fielder, be it in the slip cordon or in the outfield. Anamul uses his feet, does not get close enough to the pitch. He aimed to hit it squarer, ended up punting it straighter to long-off",

4.1,"Hasan Ali to Ahmed Shehzad, no run, back of a length and angled in on off, punched to cover",
4.2,"Hasan Ali to Ahmed Shehzad, OUT, Hasan bounces out Shehzad. Quetta lose their top three inside five overs. Shehzad is being asked to wait. The umpires check for a possible no-ball. It looks tight. Think the foot is on the line. The benefit of the doubt should go to Hasan. TV umpire Raza ultimately sends Shehzad back. Quick short ball on off, aimed at the chest of Shehzad. He is late onto the pull, ends up top-edging it to midwicket",

11.3,"Jordan to Anwar Ali, 1 leg bye, back of a length and angled in on middle, grazes the pad and sneaks away fine on the off side. Height was an issue. Think it was slipping down leg as well",

12.4,"Mohammad Asghar to Ervine, OUT, Asghar returns and takes down Ervine. He celebrates the wicket with a fist pump. Sammy is pumped too. Poor shot from Ervine. He backs away outside leg, exposing his stumps. Then looks to cut a ball that isn't really short. Looks to cut against the spin. Eventually, he does not make contact. The ball skids on and it's timbaaah",
12.5,"Mohammad Asghar to Mohammad Nawaz, OUT, stumping chance sent upstairs. Tossed up and drifts away outside off, drags Nawaz forward and goes past the outside edge. Kamran collects the ball and takes the bails off. Nawaz loses his balance and lifts his back leg. Seems like the foot is on the line by the time the bails come off. Tough one for Raza, the TV umpire. Out is the verdict. Two wickets in two balls, Peshawar are closing in on the title",

16.2,"Hasan Ali to Emrit, 1 run, short and outside off, smeared away to deep midwicket, straight to the fielder",
16.3,"Hasan Ali to Zulfiqar Babar, OUT, Peshawar Zalmi are the champions of the second season of the PSL! The fireworks go off, and Sammy calls his boys for the selfie celebration. Then every Peshawar player attempts the Afridi star-man pose. The crowd goes berserk. Well done, Peshawar. They rejoice further. It was Hasan who set it up with the new ball and sealed it with the old one. This was full and right on the off stump. Babar looks to slug it away across the line. He only connects with a whole lot of thin air. The off stump is tilted back",
