Rafatullah slashes away from the body and is surprised by the extra bounce.

2.6,"Hasan Ali to Haddin, OUT, that's a superb delivery. Cuts back in from the short of a length region and Haddin is looking to tuck it away off the pads into the leg side. It keeps a tad low and he gets rapped on the pads and the umpire's finger goes up almost straightaway. What a start for Peshawar. Islamabad are 15 for 2 after three overs. This is exactly what Peshawar needed defending a low total",

4.5,"Hasan Ali to Smith, 1 run, length ball, skidding through and cutting back in again and Smith manages to tucks it away into the leg side off the pads. Did he get an inside edge on to the pads there? He did as the bowler goes up in a stifled appeal but no problems there",
4.6,"Hasan Ali to Billings, no run, fullish length ball outside off, comes forward and blocks and drills it hard into the turf as the ball goes behind the stumps, towards the wicketkeeper after it bounces",

5.5,"Wahab Riaz to Smith, no run, cramps him for room by bowling it on off. It's back of a length but Smith can only tap it to the off side off the backfoot. This is good bowling. Can he make Smith try to force something here?",

6.4,"Shakib Al Hasan to Smith, no run, backs away and tries to hammer this one away through the off side but can only work it back to the bowler. Smith is struggling here",
6.5,"Shakib Al Hasan to Smith, SIX, Shakib does well to toss it up and gets it to turn away but Smith brings in the long handle as he reaches out for it and carves it straight down the ground, for a clean six. That was just power that saved him there. Shakib won't be too discouraged by that",
6.6,"Shakib Al Hasan to Smith, no run, skews it off the splice to the covers region",
7.1,"Shahid Afridi to Billings, 1 run, comes down the track and clips it away to midwicket",
7.2,"Shahid Afridi to Smith, 1 run, stays in the crease and tries to whip this through the leg side but does not middle it and the ball goes towards the short leg fielder.

7.4,"Shahid Afridi to Smith, no run, stays back and looks to work this through the off side but the ball spins the other way as it's the googly and takes the inside edge of Smith's blade",
7.5,"Shahid Afridi to Smith, SIX, long handle again, that's another pressure-releasing shot. Afridi floats up a length ball and offers up a lot of width outside off and Smith has all the time in the world to get down on one knee and slog it long and hard over deep midwicket",
7.6,"Shahid Afridi to Smith, no run",
8.1,"Wahab Riaz to Billings, no run, tries to make room and carve this short of a length ball through the off side but cannot beat backward point",

8.4,"Wahab Riaz to Billings, OUT, comes down the track and looks to carve this short of a length ball through the off side but he gets an inside edge and chops it on to the stumps.

8.6,"Wahab Riaz to Misbah-ul-Haq, no run, comes forward and reaches out to this wide ball and knocks it to the right of point who slides across to get his hands to it",['SW Billings b Wahab Riaz 11 (16b 1x4 0x6) SR: 68.75']

9.4,"Shahid Afridi to Smith, 1 run, shorter in length and it is slapped off the backfoot past the bowler. Afridi sticks his hand out but that was travelling and Hasan Ali runs across, slides and stops it away before getting up and flicking it back to Jordan. Good team effort",
9.5,"Shahid Afridi to Misbah-ul-Haq, no run, shorter in length, cut to backward point",
9.6,"Shahid Afridi to Misbah-ul-Haq, no run, length ball, Misbah blocks from the crease and Afridi almost leaps up in celebration as the ball nearly takes out the stumps off the pads. He got a thickish inside edge",
10.1,"Junaid Khan to Smith, FOUR, length ball that is angled away and there is just enough room for Smith who stays leg side of the ball and absolutelu pummels it with a half-angled bat past mid-off who starts to his right but has no chance to get to it",
10.2,"Junaid Khan to Smith, no run, full toss, misses out as he tries to drag it away into the leg side and closes the face of his bat. Went too hard at it and messed up the timing",
10.3,"Junaid Khan to Smith, SIX, slightly slower and on a fullish length outside off. It is going away from him but Smith once again opts to heave it over the leg side. Does not find the middle of the bat but still decent enough connection as the ball goes to the cow corner boundary",
10.4,"Junaid Khan to Smith, FOUR, that's just brute force. Half-volley outside off and Smith puts the right foot across while making sure he gives himself enough room before crashing it through extra cover",
10.5,"Junaid Khan to Smith, no run, slower short ball, gets up and tries to flay it through the off side but goes through with the shot early and gets beaten by the lack of pace",

11.4,"Shahid Afridi to Smith, 1 run, back of a length and it is whipped off the backfoot very hard back to the bowler. Was that a chance! Yes, it was. That was flat-batted with immense power and Afridi barely had time to react to it. Gets his fingers to it but cannot hold on to the ball. Unfair to call that a dropped catch",
11.5,"Shahid Afridi to Misbah-ul-Haq, 1 run",
11.6,"Shahid Afridi to Smith, FOUR, short ball, stays in the crease before pulling it away deep midwicket and the ball screams into the deep midwicket boundary",

12.5,"Shakib Al Hasan to Misbah-ul-Haq, OUT, Misbah falters on the pull shot. Not a great delivery. Short and he swivels around with the pull but does not time it too well. Sends it straight into the hands of Wahab Riaz at deep midwicket. That maybe didn't sit up as well as he would have liked. And he got it off the toe end of the bat",
12.6,"Shakib Al Hasan to Watson, 1 run, slightly short of good length, Watson backs before punching it against the angle to long-off",
13.1,"Shahid Afridi to Watson, no run, length ball, stays a tad low outside off and he gets an inside edge that goes back to the right of Afridi",

13.3,"Shahid Afridi to Watson, 1 run, shorter in length and a little bit of width on offer, slapped out to sweeper cover",
13.4,"Shahid Afridi to Smith, FOUR, missed chance in front of the straight boundary. Smith lofts this length ball down the ground but does not get the elevation desired. Hasan Ali runs across to his left from long-on but he has over-run the ball and to is horror, watches it cross the boundary after landing in front of it. How costly will that lapse prove?",
13.5,"Shahid Afridi to Smith, no run, appeal for caught behind, not given. That was gone, there was an edge but the umpire didn't think so. Smith was looking to open the bat face from too close to the body and gets an outside edge. Kamran Akmal has taken a sharp catch behind the stumps. Afridi was late in appealing and Peshawar are denied a wicket",
13.6,"Shahid Afridi to Smith, no run",
14.1,"Shakib Al Hasan to Watson, 1 run, worked down to long-on",
14.2,"Shakib Al Hasan to Smith, 1 run, tossed up delivery, eased down to long-on off the front foot",
14.3,"Shakib Al Hasan to Watson, FOUR, short and some width on offer outside off. Watson cuts hard off the back foot and the ball goes through extra cover where the fielder makes a mess of it and lets the ball go from through his legs as he dives",
14.4,"Shakib Al Hasan to Watson, 1 run, good length ball from Shakib, Watson punches it off the backfoot through covers",
14.5,"Shakib Al Hasan to Smith, 1 run, short of a length and wide outside off, punched off the backfoot through the covers region. And that's the fifty for Smith. Can he finish the job for his team?",
14.6,"Shakib Al Hasan to Watson, 1 run, whipped away down the ground off the backfoot. Time for the timeout",
15.1,"Wahab Riaz to Watson, 1 run, short of a length and angling away outside off, drops it into the off side after riding the bounce and they take the single as point comes running in",
15.2,"Wahab Riaz to Smith, FOUR, full and wide outside off, enough width on offer and Smith pummels it straight over the bowler's head for a straight as an arrow boundary",
15.3,"Wahab Riaz to Smith, FOUR, short of good length and it is just nonchalantly flicked off the pads, gets it wide of the fielder at square leg and the ball goes through the deep backward square leg boundary. Can't be bowling there at this stage to a set batsman",
15.4,"Wahab Riaz to Smith, no run, starts to take a step forward and Wahab smartly drags the length back and fires a bouncer outside off and Smith is forced to let it go",
15.5,"Wahab Riaz to Smith, no run, starts to take a step forward again and Wahab bangs it in and Smith backs away before fending it off and dropping it into the off side with a flat bat. Good contest between bat and ball going on",
15.6,"Wahab Riaz to Smith, 1 run, very full ball outside off, dug out to extra cover for a quick single",
16.1,"Junaid Khan to Smith, 1 run, full toss again, very nearly another no-ball. Smith tries to go big over the leg side but cannot get hold of the shot as he flat-bats it into the hands of long-on. Does not matter. The catch does not count",
16.2,"Junaid Khan to Watson, 1 run, goes for a wide yorker again but this is a low full toss outside off and is worked away to third man. Smith back on strike",
16.3,"Junaid Khan to Smith, 1 run, still can't get the yorker right, low full toss, angling in, drilled away to long-off",
16.4,"Junaid Khan to Watson, no run, he is restlessly awitching angles but just cannot get the yorker right. Low and wide full toss and he is lucky that the batsman found the bottom end of the bat or it would have been a wide",
16.5,"Junaid Khan to Watson, SIX, make that another attempted yorker gone wrong. Full toss and lot of width and you can't get away with those at this stage of a chase. Watson flays it clean over long-off. Tamim Iqbal can only watch it go to the boundary. This is turning into a nightmarish over for Junaid and Peshawar",
16.6,"Junaid Khan to Watson, SIX, that's a humongous hit. That one lands on the roof. Watson has laid into a pull shot. Short ball from over the stumps and sits up nicely. Watson was probably expecting a short ball to be around the corner after all the attempted yorkers gone wrong. That's a mighty pull shot, played with authority. On the roof and will stay there",
17.1,"Wahab Riaz to Smith, no run, yorker on leg stump, tries to flick but is late in bringing the bat down and wears it on the pad",
17.2,"Wahab Riaz to Smith, no run, slower ball bouncer, Smith gets under it and the umpire thinks the height is fine there",

17.6,"Wahab Riaz to Smith, 1 run, short of a length outside off, slaps with a flat bat to the extra cover region and cover runs across and slides to field it. Well-done",
18.1,"Hasan Ali to Smith, SIX, Darren Sammy's six foot five frame can't get to that at the long-off boundary. Great effort as he leaps up and gets a fingertip to it but even he could not get to it as the ball clips the fingers and sails over the boundary. Full and in the slot and it is hammered over mid-off",
18.2,"Hasan Ali to Smith, 1 run, opens the bat face and steers it wide of backward point",
18.3,"Hasan Ali to Watson, 1 run, low full toss outside off, pushed off the front foot to long-off",
18.4,"Hasan Ali to Smith, 1 run, fuller ball, pushed back to the bowler and Watson is outside the crease, looking for a run. Hasan throws and misses",

18.6,"Hasan Ali to Watson, 1 run, low full toss, drilled through the covers region",
19.1,"Junaid Khan to Watson, 1 run, fuller ball on the stumps, turned away to midwicket for a single. Singles will do it for Islamabad. Five off five now",
19.2,"Junaid Khan to Smith, 1 run, bangs it in from around the wicket and Smith tries to duck but wears it on the elbow as the ball runs away into the leg side",
19.3,"Junaid Khan to Watson, 2 runs, Watson hammers this to sweeper cover and Smith comes charging back for the second. The throw comes on at the bowler's end and Junaid does not collect the ball. Had he gathered it, the batsman would have been out by a mile",
19.4,"Junaid Khan to Watson, no run, slower ball on leg stump, does not bounce and hits Watson on the pad",
19.5,"Junaid Khan to Watson, 1 run, OUT, there is a review for a run out and Watson is short of his ground. He is gone and the crowd has found its voice again. Islamabad looking to finish it off with one ball to spare but Kamran Akmal gathers the ball and whips the bails off to make sure that does not happen. Worked it with a flat bat to long-on and came charging back for the second",
19.6,"Junaid Khan to Amad Butt, 1 run, Junaid gets the yorker wrong and bowls a low full toss. Amad drills it past the diving mid-on fielder to take the single and pumps the air in delight. What a match",
