0.2,"Mohammad Irfan to Kamran Akmal, 1 run, stays in this crease to this length ball and steers it to third man with an open bat face",
0.3,"Mohammad Irfan to Tamim Iqbal, 1 run, fuller ball, angling in on the stumps, closes the bat face a tad early and so does not time it too well as the ball is drilled to midwicket",
0.4,"Mohammad Irfan to Kamran Akmal, no run, fuller outside off, around the fifth-stump channel, drilled off the front foot towards mid-off",
0.5,"Mohammad Irfan to Kamran Akmal, 1 run, short of a length, pitching on leg stump channel, does not sit up as much but Kamran manages to pull it away to deep backward square leg",

2.1,"Mohammad Irfan to Kamran Akmal, FOUR, makes up his mind early and stays leg side of the ball as Irfan fires it full and on middle and angling away after pitching. Kamran keeps the front leg inside the line of the ball that allows him room to free his arms and pummel it down the ground",
2.2,"Mohammad Irfan to Kamran Akmal, 1 run, SHadab makes a brilliant effort at backward point and almost pulls off a stunner. It's a full toss and Kamran flays it but does not keep it along the ground. Shadab leaps to his left and gets his hands to it but the ball ricochets and goes to third man. Brilliant effort though",
2.3,"Mohammad Irfan to Tamim Iqbal, no run, tries to heave it over the leg side and gets an inside edge to mid-on",
2.4,"Mohammad Irfan to Tamim Iqbal, 1 run, walks across the stumps and pulls but perhaps cramped himself for room as he did it. The ball is short enough but he has does not give himself enough room to free his arms and the ball goes to the on side",

2.6,"Mohammad Irfan to Kamran Akmal, no run, short ball again, this time he is rushed for pace and he gets hit hard on the helmet as he misses the pull shot and goes along the ground towards mid-off.

3.2,"Rumman Raees to Tamim Iqbal, OUT, Tamim has picked out Misbah at mid-on. Does not get the elevation desired as he tries to heave it away. It's a length ball, angling in on middle and leg, not quite in the slot. Tamim cannot get the ball over the man at mid-on. Goes straight into the hands of the Islamabad captain who plucks it easily though it is hit very hard",['Tamim Iqbal c Misbah-ul-Haq b Rumman Raees 4 (8b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50.00']

3.5,"Rumman Raees to Mohammad Hafeez, FOUR, glorious cover drive. That's a tremendous shot to get off the mark. Full and angling away, wide half-volley, right in the slot for Hafeez, who presses forward, leans across and crunches a drive through the covers region. Elegance written all over it",
3.6,"Rumman Raees to Mohammad Hafeez, no run, takes off for a single after bunting this one to mid-on but is sent back by the non-striker. Hafeez is almost halfway down the pitch and he has to scamper back. Throw misses the target at the striker's end but direct hit could have had him in trouble",

4.2,"Mohammad Irfan to Mohammad Hafeez, FOUR, good length ball, angling away from Haeez. The batsman comes forward and sticks his bat out but does not do so with conviction. The angle takes the ball away from him and it takes the outside edge, beats the diving slip fielder as well as the fielder who slides before the third man boundary",
4.3,"Mohammad Irfan to Mohammad Hafeez, no run, short of a length and angling away, jumps up to negotiate the bounce before stabbing it into the off side",
4.4,"Mohammad Irfan to Mohammad Hafeez, 2 runs, back of a length ball on the stumps, jumps back into the crease and uses the depth before turning it away into the vacant midwicket region. There are two fielders converging on the ball but they have enough time to come back for the second",
4.5,"Mohammad Irfan to Mohammad Hafeez, OUT, oh, dear, isn't that a soft dismissal! Slower ball does the trick and Hafeez's lean patch continues. Goes at it with hard hands and chips it straight into the hands of mid-on where Misbah takes a straightforward catch",
4.6,"Mohammad Irfan to Morgan, no run, brilliantly bowled yorker on leg stump and all Morgan can do is jam the bat down and squeeze it out back towards the bowler",['Mohammad Hafeez c Misbah-ul-Haq b Mohammad Irfan 10 (8b 2x4 0x6) SR: 125.00']

5.2,"Rumman Raees to Morgan, no run, good length ball, Morgan comes forward and blocks into the off side, towards the covers region",
5.3,"Rumman Raees to Morgan, FOUR, comes down the track early and lofts this over mid-off. Meets the pitch of the ball and gets right on top of that before carving it well over the outstretched hands of the leaping fielder at mid-off and the ball crosses the boundary on the bounce",

5.6,"Rumman Raees to Kamran Akmal, FOUR, short of a length ball, swivels around and pulls it away fine though it keeps low, no chance for the short fine leg fielder to get that",
6.1,"Shadab Khan to Morgan, no run, starts off with a very full ball on leg stump and Morgan digs it out",
6.2,"Shadab Khan to Morgan, SIX, drags the length back and it's too easy for Morgan who gets in position early and shovels it off the backfoot. Pulls off the backfoot and it's a flat six as the ball goes over cow corner",
6.3,"Shadab Khan to Morgan, no run, makes amends and fires this full and on the stumps and Morgan presses forward and defends it back to the bowler",
6.4,"Shadab Khan to Morgan, 1 run, gets down to slog sweep this one but the bowler adjusts well by not giving the batsman any room. Morgan wears it on the pad and the ball goes fine after pitching on leg stump",
6.5,"Shadab Khan to Kamran Akmal, no run, beautifully bowled. It's short and wide outside off and Kamran was shaping for the cut shot. But it's the googly and spins back in to cramp him for room and the batsman cannot make good contact",
6.6,"Shadab Khan to Kamran Akmal, OUT, six off the second ball of the over and the bowler ends it by having the last laugh. Another googly does Kamran in. Short and Kamran goes for the cut again but this one spins in and keeps a bit low as well and strikes him n the back pad. And that was crashing into middle. Looked plumb from the moment it made contact with the pad",
7.1,"Mohammad Sami to Morgan, 1 run, full and wide, driven square of the wicket",
7.2,"Mohammad Sami to Sohaib Maqsood, no run, short ball, comes on quickly but there is enough bounce on it for the batsman to comfortably get under it",['Kamran Akmal lbw b Shadab Khan 19 (17b 3x4 0x6) SR: 111.76']
7.3,"Mohammad Sami to Sohaib Maqsood, no run, nicely done. Length ball in the corridor of uncertainty. Draws the batsman forward and Maqsood almost walks into the shot as he looks to push off the front foot into the off side. Gets beaten for his troubles",
7.4,"Mohammad Sami to Sohaib Maqsood, OUT, this was bound to happen, you could see it happening. Peshawar trying to force the pace and lose a wicket. Slightly short of a length ball, cuts back in slightly so it cramps the batsman for room as he looks to pull it. Gets a top edge that hardly carries and Sami runs back on the follow through and settles under it",
7.5,"Mohammad Sami to Morgan, no run, short of a length, angling away outside off, waits for it at the crease and stabs it to point off the backfoot",

8.1,"Shadab Khan to Shakib Al Hasan, 1 run, turned away into the leg side off the backfoot",['Sohaib Maqsood c & b Mohammad Sami 0 (3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00']
8.2,"Shadab Khan to Morgan, FOUR, that's a desperate shot, not convincing but he gets good reward for it. Gets down for a reverse sweep and gets a top edge and the ball clears short third man and goes into the boundary",

9.1,"Watson to Shakib Al Hasan, 1 run, short of a length, tries to pull it away but the ball does not get up as well and he can only nudge it off the bottom part of the bat to the leg side. Or did that go off the glove?",
9.2,"Watson to Morgan, 1 run, short ball, this one sits up nicely for Morgan who swivels around with the pull and the ball goes to deep square leg. The man at deep midwicket run to his left and cuts it off in front of the boundary",
9.3,"Watson to Shakib Al Hasan, no run, short of a length ball, angling away, flashes his blade as he looks to cut but it is a tad too close for that shot and the ball shoots past the edge and goes to the wicketkeeper",

9.5,"Watson to Morgan, no run, similar to the earlier one that beat the edge. Too close to cut though it is short and Morgan cannot make contact as he opens the bat face",
9.6,"Watson to Morgan, 1 run, fullish length ball, angling away around off, opens the bat face and runs it down to third man as they jog the single",
10.1,"Amad Butt to Morgan, 1 run, full and wide outside off, gets Morgan to reach out as he takes a long stride across and crunches it out to sweeper cover",
10.2,"Amad Butt to Shakib Al Hasan, OUT, length ball, and it was always going to be hard to loft straight down the ground from that length. Shakib presents the full face of his bat and sends it soaring into the night sky but does not get the desired distance as Sami backtracks from mid-off and snaffles it",
10.3,"Amad Butt to Morgan, no run, fullish on the stumps, turns it away to midwicket",
10.4,"Amad Butt to Morgan, no run, yorker, dug out straight down the ground",

10.6,"Amad Butt to Morgan, no run, length ball, angling away, Morgan defends off the front foot and that's the end of a superb over from Butt. Pretty accurate lines and lengths and ends up giving away just two",

11.2,"Shadab Khan to Morgan, 1 run, tossed up and fullish on off, Morgan strides forward and eases it down to long-off",
11.3,"Shadab Khan to Sammy, no run, spins back in sharply, it's the wrong'un. well-disguised and Sammy does not read it as he tries to force it through the off side off the backfoot. Gets an inside edge that could have gone on to the stumps",

13.3,"Shadab Khan to Morgan, OUT, reverse sweep, straight into the hands of Mohammad Irfan at short third man. Can't help but wonder if that fielder was in place precisely for that reason. Credit to the young legspinner, too, for being unafraid to toss it up and fire it full",
13.4,"Shadab Khan to Shahid Afridi, no run, comes forward and muscles a drive to covers",
13.5,"Shadab Khan to Shahid Afridi, no run, wrong'un again. Afridi does not find the middle of the bat as he tries to cut this short ball and chops it",

14.2,"Mohammad Irfan to Sammy, 2 runs, short of a length ball, 127.3kph, slapped away to deep point. The throw is flat from the deep and Haddin flicks the ball back towards the stumps but the batsman is back",['EJG Morgan c Mohammad Irfan b Shadab Khan 28 (28b 3x4 1x6) SR: 100.00']
14.3,"Mohammad Irfan to Sammy, FOUR, how hard did he hit that! That was hammered. In the slot is this half-volley outside off and Sammy reaches out for the heavens with his backlift before shovelling it to the right of mid-off",

14.6,"Mohammad Irfan to Sammy, FOUR, Irfan's spell ends with a boundary. Not much wrong with that delivery. It is full and on the pads and should have just been clipped away off the toes.

15.4,"Mohammad Sami to Shahid Afridi, SIX, flicked off the pads and the ball sails into the deep backward square leg boundary. Moves across the crease to open up the leg side and just lofts it clean. Misbah's expression is gold as he has his hands covering his mouth",
15.5,"Mohammad Sami to Shahid Afridi, SIX, and he pummels another one. Seems like Misbah is due for more anxious moments. More headache. Moves across to give himself some space again and whacks it over deep midwicket and it has gone way into the stands. Misbah's standing there biting his nails",

17.3,"Watson to Wahab Riaz, FOUR, short ball, tries to pull and gets a top edge and the ball flies over the leaping Brad Haddin behind the stumps. So we have had short ball, four, full ball, four, short ball, four. What does Watson have to do here?",
17.4,"Watson to Wahab Riaz, FOUR, oh, good lord! He got everything right about that ball. Wahab was backing away and Watson follows him with a yorker on leg stump channel. Wahab is only looking to dig it out and he gets the ball from between his legs off the inside edge and the ball goes to the fine leg boundary",
17.5,"Watson to Wahab Riaz, 2 runs, that's what he was looking to do the previous ball. Yorker on leg stump and it is dug out between long-on and deep midwicket. Picked the gap well, so they get two",
