Ball,Commentary,Wicket
0.1,"Hasan Ali to Ahmed Shehzad, FOUR, picks it up and smashes it to the midwicket boundary. Fine shot from Shehzad, picking up the short ball so early, shifting his weight back and hitting it so cleanly",
0.2,"Hasan Ali to Ahmed Shehzad, no run, adjusts his length, pitching it a touch fuller on off stump, so Shehzad blocks with a straight bat",
0.3,"Hasan Ali to Ahmed Shehzad, no run, some swing away from the flashing bat. Shehzad's feet this time are not quite in the best position, rooted to the crease. The width on the ball makes him play but his timing is terrible",
0.4,"Hasan Ali to Ahmed Shehzad, FOUR, dreadful misfield from Samuels at midwicket. And for a mistimed hack across the line, Shehzad has got a boundary. And that too is only because Asghar, who is chasing the ball down, puts in a panic-stricken dive, even as it holds up in the outfield. He touches the ball, and at the same time his knee touches the rope",
0.5,"Hasan Ali to Ahmed Shehzad, 1 run, tip and run towards point, but this is going to be risky. Hafeez is the man hunting the ball down, and with a direct hit, there might have been trouble",
0.6,"Hasan Ali to Wright, FOUR, back of a length on middle and leg, Wright dinks it around the corner behind square leg and Haris Sohail, the fielder, essentially escorts the ball to the fence. Not the best start for Peshawar, especially with their fielding",
1.1,"Mohammad Asghar to Ahmed Shehzad, no run, keeps it wicket to wicket on a good length, Shehzad tries a little clip to square leg but has no timing",
1.2,"Mohammad Asghar to Ahmed Shehzad, no run, does his bit to get runs by running down the pitch, but he makes that move way too early. Asghar pushes it through quicker and cramps him for room. Thuds into the pads as he flicks around his front pad",
1.3,"Mohammad Asghar to Ahmed Shehzad, FOUR, well played. No premeditation. Just waits on the bad ball - and it comes - short and wide and it's smashed to the point boundary",
1.4,"Mohammad Asghar to Ahmed Shehzad, FOUR, lovely timing. Again, the shot is made because he waits on the ball to arrive into his half and then brings his wrists into play. Flicks through straight midwicket",
1.5,"Mohammad Asghar to Ahmed Shehzad, 1 run, charges out now, and Asghar slows it right down. Works it to long-on",
1.6,"Mohammad Asghar to Wright, 1 run, little nudge to the left of midwicket to keep strike",
2.1,"Hasan Ali to Wright, no run, looks like the batsman can hit through the line on this pitch. Hasan gives up a back of a length ball outside off and Wright hammers it to point",
2.2,"Hasan Ali to Wright, no run, good bowling. This seems like the slower ball, pitching on a good length outside off, Wright slogs across the line and the ball sneaks under the bat",
2.3,"Hasan Ali to Wright, SIX, smashed straight over the bowler's head. Hasan makes the mistake of bowling length to Wright on a pretty decent batting track. A full swing of the arms and it's straight into the crowd over long-on. Taken as well, by the spectator",
2.4,"Hasan Ali to Wright, 1 run, fierce strike again, this time to a short ball. Pummels it to deep square leg.",
2.5,"Hasan Ali to Ahmed Shehzad, 1 run, pulls off the front foot, for this back of a length delivery outside off doesn't necessarily come onto the bat like the others. Single to deep square leg",
2.6,"Hasan Ali to Wright, OUT, chops on! Clever change of pace from Hasan and he certainly does enjoy pulling one over Wright. Pitches on a decent length outside off, the batsman thinks he can cut because of the width but hits too hard and plays too early",['LJ Wright b Hasan Ali 12 (7b 1x4 1x6) SR: 171.42']
3.1,"Jordan to Ahmed Shehzad, 2 runs, excellent timing again, and Samuels on the third man boundary is put under immense pressure. Shehzad hangs back, opens the face late, concentrates on placement and that's why he gets two runs",
3.2,"Jordan to Pietersen, 2 runs, works it off his pads towards the square leg boundary. A touch too straight and the batsman shuffles back and across to pick the gap to the right of the man in the deep",
3.3,"Jordan to Pietersen, 1 run, goes hard at the fuller delivery wide of off stump, but with the ball, this time, not coming onto the bat, Pietersen inside edges to long leg",
3.4,"Jordan to Ahmed Shehzad, no run, legcutter, full and wide outside off, Shehzad, by opting to slog into the leg side, just gets a toe-end to mid-on",
3.5,"Jordan to Ahmed Shehzad, 1 run, does well to pick the change of pace, and even manages to manoeuvre it to the left of midwicket for a quick single",
3.6,"Jordan to Pietersen, 1 run, full and straight, Pietersen clips it to the right of mid-on for a single",
4.1,"Mohammad Asghar to Pietersen, 1 run, strides down the pitch and looks to take a good length ball outside off stump into midwicket. Only gets an inside edge to pad and then to point",
4.2,"Mohammad Asghar to Ahmed Shehzad, no run, some turn as he tosses it up outside off. Shehzad opens the face to block to point",
4.3,"Mohammad Asghar to Ahmed Shehzad, no run, fuller delivery on middle, Shehzad blocks",
4.4,"Mohammad Asghar to Ahmed Shehzad, 1 run, slugs it to deep midwicket, clearing the front leg the moment he sees the flatter ball angling into middle and leg",
4.5,"Mohammad Asghar to Pietersen, 1 leg bye, looks for the paddle sweep, it doesn't seem like he has made connection with the bat. Asghar goes for the lbw appeal, but this seems like the impact is outside off. Peshawar go for a review, possibly the first in a T20. Replays suggest KP might even have got glove to it - he showed his bat to the umpire whilst he was running down the pitch - but it is ruled as a leg bye. And not out because Hawk-Eye says ball hits pad outside off. Not the brightest use of DRS.",
4.6,"Mohammad Asghar to Ahmed Shehzad, 1 run, the arm ball again, quick and flat on fourth stump. Shehzhad makes the mistake of cutting it and still escapes with a bottom edge past the keeper's right",
5.1,"Wahab Riaz to Ahmed Shehzad, FOUR, carves it to the point boundary. Any time there is pace on the ball, batting looks easy. Here for example, Shehzad simply holds in his stance and slashes it away",
5.2,"Wahab Riaz to Ahmed Shehzad, 1 run, back of a length on off stump, dabs it to point for a single",
5.3,"Wahab Riaz to Pietersen, 1 leg bye, ooh, KP gets hit twice and ends up taking an appeal for obstructing the field. It all begins with him getting beaten for pace on middle and leg stump. Shehzad calls his partner through for a single, and in trying to make his ground, KP first runs into Wahab, who is trying to get to the ball, and then takes the throw in the back of the leg. Sammy withdraws the appeal, and it wouldn't have worked away considering KP did not change direction as he runs",
5.4,"Wahab Riaz to Ahmed Shehzad, 1 run, jumps off his feet to handle a 137 kph delivery, shortish on leg stump. Somehow pats it into the extra cover region for a single",
5.5,"Wahab Riaz to Pietersen, SIX, fetch that! This has gone out of the stadium, Length ball - pacy length ball - on middle and KP just clears his front leg and monsters it over square leg. Boy, the crack that came off the bat...",
5.6,"Wahab Riaz to Ahmed Shehzad, no run, lack of bounce saves a full delivery in the slot for the slog. Shehzad hangs back, expecting the length to be really full, and swings with all his might but it sneaks under his bat",
6.1,"Mohammad Asghar to Pietersen, 1 run, plays outside the line of an arm ball, essentially looking for it to turn. KP gets an inside edge behind square leg. Left-arm spin to KP. Fun",
6.2,"Mohammad Asghar to Ahmed Shehzad, 1 run, comes down the track to whip a fuller delivery through midwicket",
6.3,"Mohammad Asghar to Pietersen, 1 leg bye, looks to heave it over the leg side again, but Asghar does well, firing it full and following the batsman making room to free the arms",
6.4,"Mohammad Asghar to Ahmed Shehzad, 1 run, tosses it wider, slows it up too, Shehzad has to adjust, with his front foot coming down outside leg. He reaches out to hit it to point",
6.5,"Mohammad Asghar to Pietersen, SIX, look out in the crowd! Races down the pitch, turns a length ball into an overpitched one and swings free. Such quick feet. Such fierce power.",
6.6,"Mohammad Asghar to Pietersen, SIX, and that's outta here too. Good use of the feet from KP, then he opens up his hips to target the leg side, having realised Asghar is really not intent on spinning the ball away, and rather in cramping the batsman up. Heaves it over square leg. It's KP's 200th T20 six",
7.1,"Shahid Afridi to Ahmed Shehzad, FOUR, picks the gap between point and short third man. Runs from both ends, and even Peshawar's trump card is being berated",
7.2,"Shahid Afridi to Ahmed Shehzad, SIX, over long-on, the big hits just don't stop and this raises the 50 partnership off only 28 balls. This shot is simply a big old wind up, getting under the ball and powering it away. The good thing both batsmen are doing is trying to hit straight (unless of course the ball is skirting down leg, when square leg, midwicket open up and the road outside the stadium are all game)",
7.3,"Shahid Afridi to Ahmed Shehzad, SIX, more! And it's been caught in the crowd too. Shimmy down the pitch, sees a length ball, loves that it gives him room to free the arms and flat-bats it so very very hard",
7.4,"Shahid Afridi to Ahmed Shehzad, 1 run, shifts back in his crease to a slow, length ball on off stump, and whips it through midwicket",
7.5,"Shahid Afridi to Pietersen, 1 run, well bowled. A lot quicker, a bit fuller, and careening into leg stump. KP just about plonks his bat down to save himself",
7.6,"Shahid Afridi to Ahmed Shehzad, 1 run, completes a fifty in the play-off and exults. Brings up the landmark with a neat little clip through to long-on",
8.1,"Jordan to Ahmed Shehzad, no run, back of a length and outside off, cuts to point",
8.2,"Jordan to Ahmed Shehzad, 1 run, looks for the wide yorker and Shehzad sends it to deep third man",
8.3,"Jordan to Pietersen, 1 run, aims at the toes of KP, who keeps them out of the way and flicks to deep midwicket",
8.4,"Jordan to Ahmed Shehzad, 2 runs, slower ball robs Shehzad of timing, and this loft, meant to go over mid-off, scythes over cover point.",
8.5,"Jordan to Ahmed Shehzad, 1 run, low full toss on off stump, drills it to mid-off, where Sammy, the captain, misfields and allows a single.",
8.6,"Jordan to Pietersen, FOUR, one-bounce over backward point. For the slightest moment it seems like Jordan does KP with a full and wide delivery outside off, but he is so tall, and has such reach that he connects and connects well",
9.1,"Sammy to Ahmed Shehzad, SIX, poor start. It's a loosener, a length ball on middle and leg and Shehzad tees off over midwicket.",
9.2,"Sammy to Ahmed Shehzad, 1 run, goes wide of the crease for a back of a length delivery, Shehzad flat-bats it to long-off",
9.3,"Sammy to Pietersen, 1 run, a length ball trying to sneak past the batsman outside off is clubbed unceremoniously to deep midwicket. No respite",
9.4,"Sammy to Ahmed Shehzad, SIX, that's another ball lost. Takes the power position, weight on the front foot, bat waiting high over his head, and when the length ball arrives, it disappears. Out of the ground over midwicket",
9.5,"Sammy to Ahmed Shehzad, FOUR, goes past the keeper! Possibly a half-chance. The dive is late, but then again, Shehzad has got a sizeable edge to this yorker outside off.",
9.6,"Sammy to Ahmed Shehzad, OUT, some relief for Sammy and his team. He bowls back of a length, but does so without giving too much room for the batsman to work with. Shehzad brute-forces it down the ground, makes contact off the high part of the bat and pops a catch to long-off",
10.1,"Mohammad Hafeez to Pietersen, 2 runs, fires it full on leg stump, KP clears his front leg and smites it to deep square leg",['Ahmed Shehzad c Wahab Riaz b Sammy 71 (38b 7x4 4x6) SR: 186.84']
10.2,"Mohammad Hafeez to Pietersen, FOUR, bisects square leg and midwicket on the boundary. Top shot. The ploy to cramp KP on leg stump is not working. He is simply making his own room and smacking it away",
10.3,"Mohammad Hafeez to Pietersen, 1 run, slower through the air, and outside off, dabs it behind point",
10.4,"Mohammad Hafeez to Rossouw, 2 runs, good shot, it's not often that the ball has been hit this well tonight along the ground. Makes room on leg stump and drives through the line to extra cover",
10.5,"Mohammad Hafeez to Rossouw, 1 run, backs away and cuts to deep point",
10.6,"Mohammad Hafeez to Pietersen, 1 run, misses out considering this is a full toss, giving free reign to swing the arms. KP picks out deep midwicket",
11.1,"Wahab Riaz to Pietersen, no run, starts with a slower ball, pushing it across KP. He goes for it, looking for six over long-on, but misses completely because of the change in pace",
11.2,"Wahab Riaz to Pietersen, OUT, that's high, and it's taken at deep midwicket. Goes bang against a length ball, but this time, he seems to get it off the bottom of the bat. This is a pressure catch, and it's swirling high in the air as well. Asghar steadies himself under it and does the job beautifully, reverse cup, over his head. Wahab got hit out of the ground a few overs ago, now he's sent the batsman who did that off the pitch",
11.3,"Wahab Riaz to Rossouw, 1 run, whips a length ball from outside off to deep midwicket",
11.4,"Wahab Riaz to Sarfraz Ahmed, 1 run, back of a length and outside off, Sarfraz, the new batsman, taps towards point to rotate strike",['KP Pietersen c Mohammad Asghar b Wahab Riaz 40 (22b 2x4 3x6) SR: 181.81']
11.5,"Wahab Riaz to Rossouw, 1 run, keeps to a single with a very full ball on middle. Rossouw, backing away, can only bunt it to mid-off",
11.6,"Wahab Riaz to Sarfraz Ahmed, 2 runs, shortish on leg stump, nudges it through square leg. Should only have been four off the over, but it's five as Wahab, after chasing the ball down himself, zings an extra as overthrows.",
12.1,"Mohammad Hafeez to Rossouw, 1 run, good length on middle, but Rossouw backs away and hammers it to long-off",
12.2,"Mohammad Hafeez to Sarfraz Ahmed, 1 run, full toss - a high one on off stump - Sarfraz works it past midwicket",
12.3,"Mohammad Hafeez to Rossouw, 1 leg bye, beats him in flight, tossing the ball up on middle and leg. Rossouw, coming down the track, is struck on the pad as he flicks around it. Sarfraz is awake to the run as the ball meanders into the off side",
12.4,"Mohammad Hafeez to Sarfraz Ahmed, 1 run, shimmies down to a good length ball on off stump and nudges it through midwicket",
12.5,"Mohammad Hafeez to Rossouw, 1 run, full toss on leg stump, lifts it to long-off. Should do more with those deliveries",
12.6,"Mohammad Hafeez to Sarfraz Ahmed, 1 run, length on middle, Sarfraz punches it to long-on. That's a mere six runs off the over. Two good ones from Peshawar",
13.1,"Shahid Afridi to Sarfraz Ahmed, no run, superbly done. Goes wide of the crease and slingshots a full delivery on leg stump. Sarfraz, making room, is suddenly stuck and has to defend",
13.2,"Shahid Afridi to Sarfraz Ahmed, 1 run, opens the face and dabs a fuller delivery on leg stump towards cover point. Quick through the air, no room to work with",
13.3,"Shahid Afridi to Rossouw, no run, seems like the wrong 'un, and Rossouw might just have picked it, backing away and cutting to cover",
13.4,"Shahid Afridi to Rossouw, 1 leg bye, cramps him on leg stump, and Rossouw, looking to flick, misses. Has to settle for a leg bye",
13.5,"Shahid Afridi to Sarfraz Ahmed, no run, leaps outside leg - as he often did against Herath right here in an epic Test - cuts to point",
13.6,"Shahid Afridi to Sarfraz Ahmed, no run, full, quick, and at leg stump. Sarfraz leaps beside it to try and smack through the covers. No timing whatsoever",
14.1,"Hasan Ali to Rossouw, 1 run, swings across the line, but the short of a good length ball skews towards cover. Onto him too quickly",
14.2,"Hasan Ali to Sarfraz Ahmed, 1 run, slower ball - places it wide of the batsman's reach outside off - Sarfraz bunts it to long-on",
14.3,"Hasan Ali to Rossouw, 1 run, thunders down the track, making room to leg, but Hasan doesn't give any. Only a single to deep point",
14.4,"Hasan Ali to Sarfraz Ahmed, 1 run, back of a length slower ball, Sarfraz guides it to deep third man",
14.5,"Hasan Ali to Rossouw, 2 runs, leading edge, just lobs over Sammy running back from mid-off. Goes for a flick and the full ball on leg stump doesn't quite arrive as quickly as he thinks",
14.6,"Hasan Ali to Rossouw, 2 runs, takes a length ball on middle, having moved to leg, and smacks it to the right of mid-off. Sammy dives a touch too early, but is somehow able to recover",
15.1,"Jordan to Sarfraz Ahmed, 1 run, smears a half-volley to cover, where Afridi stops a stinger. Frustration apparent with Sarfraz kicking the turf",
15.2,"Jordan to Rossouw, 1 run, full and just outside off, but with Rossouw clearing the front leg, he only just makes contact for a single into the off side just past the cut strip",
15.3,"Jordan to Sarfraz Ahmed, 1 run, full on middle, punches it to mid-off",
15.4,"Jordan to Rossouw, 2 runs, aims for the blockhole wide outside off, doesn't quite get it. Rossouw carves the ball to the right of deep point",
15.5,"Jordan to Rossouw, 1 run, whips one to long-on's left, having to take care to clear the front leg against a very full ball on leg stump",
15.6,"Jordan to Sarfraz Ahmed, 1 run, goes for the blockhole on leg, Sarfraz taps it down to long-on.",
16.1,"Wahab Riaz to Sarfraz Ahmed, 1 run, hacks it towards deep midwicket",
16.2,"Wahab Riaz to Rossouw, 1 leg bye, not the pace you'd want a full toss coming at your body - Rossow takes a 145 kph delivery on the thigh as he tries to shovel it through square leg",
16.3,"Wahab Riaz to Sarfraz Ahmed, 1 run, backs away and launches a full delivery outside off to deep third man",
16.4,"Wahab Riaz to Rossouw, OUT, middle stump cracks open. Rossouw's tortured stay ends as he swings across the line of a simple straight ball and misses altogether",
16.5,"Wahab Riaz to Anwar Ali, FOUR, this is close... this could be stunning.... Sammy, heart on his sleeve Sammy has run back several yards from mid-off, tracking the ball over his shoulder. Reaches out to try and take the catch, but it bobbles off his fingertips and into the boundary. Mistimed hack down the ground gets Anwar off the mark",
16.6,"Wahab Riaz to Anwar Ali, 2 runs, works it to deep mdiwicket, and they go for a second run, good work from Anwar, with a full length dive with the bat face pointing down. He's safe",
17.1,"Jordan to Sarfraz Ahmed, 1 run, full toss - that's very high - Sarfraz heaves it into the midwicket region. Replays indicate it is well above the waist. Sarfraz is aggrieved. Makes no effort to hide it either, demanding the square leg umpire to call it no-ball",['RR Rossouw b Wahab Riaz 17 (18b 0x4 0x6) SR: 94.44']
17.2,"Jordan to Anwar Ali, 1 leg bye, low full toss sliding down leg. Anwar, prior to the ball coming at him, has splayed his legs and heaves. No bat, flicks off the top of the pad to long leg",
17.3,"Jordan to Sarfraz Ahmed, 1 run, good bowling. One-ups Sarfraz's intentions to make room outside leg with a wide yorker. The batsman manages to reach out and slash it to the sweeper",
17.4,"Jordan to Anwar Ali, 2 runs, back leg goes outside off, and that's where Jordan aims the ball. Flicks to deep midwicket",
17.5,"Jordan to Anwar Ali, no run, jumps outside leg, Jordan says thank you very much and bowls a simple length ball, close to the tram lines outside off, and gets away with a dot ball",
17.6,"Jordan to Anwar Ali, 1 run, nails the blockhole on off stump, Anwar clips it through midwicket",
18.1,"Hasan Ali to Anwar Ali, FOUR, top sails to the boundary behind him. Hasan bowls short, with third man up, and Anwar, going for a pull, is beaten for sheer pace but still profits",
18.2,"Hasan Ali to Anwar Ali, FOUR, another edge to the third man boundary. It's full, it';s wide, Anwar tries to belt it over the covers, but he'll be happy for these runs. Should be bowling slower balls to this field",
18.3,"Hasan Ali to Anwar Ali, 1 run, nails the yorker outside off, Anwar squeezes it out with a closed face to deep midwicket",
18.4,"Hasan Ali to Sarfraz Ahmed, 1 run, third man is back now, and a full delivery outside off is steered to the fielder",
18.5,"Hasan Ali to Anwar Ali, 2 runs, OUT, low full toss outside off, carves it to the left of Afridi at cover. This looks to be two, but Anwar seems to be haring back for the third. This is going to be a run-out and it is with a good throw at the right end.",
18.6,"Hasan Ali to Sarfraz Ahmed, OUT, sweetly done. The inside edge doesn't go past the cut strip, but Sarfraz thinks there is a single. Hasan spots the chance for another run-out, races up to the ball, and then races up to the stumps with it to send the Quetta captain back. Saad Nasim, the new man, didn't like it but should he have crossed and sacrificed his wicket?",
19.1,"Wahab Riaz to Saad Nasim, 1 run, short of a length on off stump, pulls it to deep square leg",
19.2,"Wahab Riaz to Mohammad Nawaz, 1 run, full and outside off, drills it to cover",
19.3,"Wahab Riaz to Saad Nasim, FOUR, good work. He gets the ball exactly where he wants it - down leg with fine leg up. A swivel pull sends it away to the boundary. Academic",
19.4,"Wahab Riaz to Saad Nasim, FOUR, another one to fine leg. Deflects a short ball outside leg, having drawn it out by moving around in his crease. Poor bowling, and Afridi yells at his bowler for it",['Sarfraz Ahmed run out 17 (20b 0x4 0x6) SR: 85.00']
19.5,"Wahab Riaz to Saad Nasim, OUT, knocks him over. That's all is necessary. And the fuming fast bowler just turns around and walks back - no celebrations despite making a mess of Nasim's stumps. Pin-point yorker that the batsman slogs all around",
19.6,"Wahab Riaz to Hasan Khan, 1 run, shortish on off stump, the batsman pulls, gets a glove to point, and they get 200.",
