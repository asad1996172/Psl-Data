Ball,Commentary,Wicket
0.1,"Anwar Ali to Kamran Akmal, no run, short of a good length and outside off, Kamran slaps it to cover point",
0.2,"Anwar Ali to Kamran Akmal, no run, belts a length ball on off stump to mid-off",
0.3,"Anwar Ali to Kamran Akmal, no run, nice control from Anwar, allowing no room outside off, preventing the batsman from getting under it as well. Chops the ball to cover",
0.4,"Anwar Ali to Kamran Akmal, no run, change of pace, and the 115 kph delivery is sliced to point",
0.5,"Anwar Ali to Kamran Akmal, no run, and he bowls a bouncer? Kamran bails out of it. Could easily have gone after the ball. Top edge could have flown for four too. But perhaps deep square leg dissuaded him from going after it",
0.6,"Anwar Ali to Kamran Akmal, 1 run, only one off the over, as this ball, full on off stump, is sent to long-on",
1.1,"Zulfiqar Babar to Kamran Akmal, OUT, first ball, Zulfiqar you beauty! Does little more than put the ball in the right areas. Here that means on a good length and outside off. Kamran, under pressure by the required rate, goes for a slog and gets a top edge to mid-on",['Kamran Akmal c Pietersen b Zulfiqar Babar 1 (7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 14.28']
1.2,"Zulfiqar Babar to Samuels, 1 run, goes very wide of the crease for a length ball on leg stump, flicks it through square leg. Zulfiqar has recovered from those seven wides",
1.3,"Zulfiqar Babar to Malan, 1 run, oopsy, Nawaz digs out a large part of the outfield, while trying to slide on his left knee. Many a career-ending injury has happened in this very manner. Nothing of such drastic proportions here, after a flick towards midwicket",
1.4,"Zulfiqar Babar to Samuels, no run, quicker delivery on leg stump, defends",
1.5,"Zulfiqar Babar to Samuels, OUT, utter chaos! And it's tied up in a neat little bow as Shehzad, fielding the ball at midwicket, basically jogs up to the keeper's, a smile as wide as any Zulfiqar bowled the other day, and knocks Samuels over. He plays a flick and looks for a run when there was never one there. He'll have to ponder over this dreadful piece of decision making now in the dressing room",
1.6,"Zulfiqar Babar to Mohammad Hafeez, 1 run, quicker delivery on leg stump, whips it through square leg",['MN Samuels run out 1 (3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33']
2.1,"Hasan Khan to Mohammad Hafeez, FOUR, superb shot. Comes down the track, but doesn't give the bowler any indication of it. Gets to the pitch of the ball on leg stump and drives it serenely past mid-on",
2.2,"Hasan Khan to Mohammad Hafeez, no run, fuller delivery on off stump, defends",
2.3,"Hasan Khan to Mohammad Hafeez, FOUR, gorgeous shot. This is all very minimalist from Hafeez. Stays beside the full, quick arm ball and by maintaining his balance and composure, he is able to slice it away to the point boundary. So classy",
2.4,"Hasan Khan to Mohammad Hafeez, 4 leg byes, drifts it down leg and Hafeez sweeps. No bat, but he does get a little pad to the long leg boundary.",
2.5,"Hasan Khan to Mohammad Hafeez, no run, nudges it back down the pitch.",
2.6,"Hasan Khan to Mohammad Hafeez, no run, goes for the sweep again, to a quick arm ball on middle, Hafeez sweeps across the line and weathers a huge lbw shout. Will they review? The option is available. Huge discussion, but they opt against it, worried that it may come as umpire's call on hitting the leg stump",
3.1,"Mills to Malan, FOUR, through cover. There's precious little wrong with this ball - fullish and a shade outside off - but Malan without moving his feet just flays the ball away",
3.2,"Mills to Malan, 1 run, short ball angled into the left-hander, Malan pulls down, and to deep square leg",
3.3,"Mills to Mohammad Hafeez, no run, defends a back of a length ball on off stump",
3.4,"Mills to Mohammad Hafeez, no run, steers a short delivery off the front foot to cover. Crisp and classical",
3.5,"Mills to Mohammad Hafeez, FOUR, excellent placement. The angle of the ball is coming into the right-hander, who makes use of it with a shuffle outside off, and then does all that is needed, a little clip to the left of short fine leg. The fielder chasing the ball tries to stop it with a boot. That's a touch lazy",
3.6,"Mills to Mohammad Hafeez, 1 run, shortish and outside off, dabs it to deep third man",
4.1,"Anwar Ali to Mohammad Hafeez, no run, fuller ball on off stump, defends to the right of extra cover.",
4.2,"Anwar Ali to Mohammad Hafeez, no run, takes the pace off this back of a length ball outside off and Hafeez, for once, is found wanting for timing tonight. Beaten",
4.3,"Anwar Ali to Mohammad Hafeez, 1 run, picks up a short ball on off stump and swivel pulls it to long leg",
4.4,"Anwar Ali to Malan, 2 runs, belts a short ball towards the midwicket boundary, Shehzad the fielder hares after it and puts in a good dive to keep it to just two, Malan looking like he's hitting form. Solid pull shot",
4.5,"Anwar Ali to Malan, no run, beautifully bowled. This is a length ball on off stump, all the pace yanked off it, Malan tries to dab it to third man and misses altogether",
4.6,"Anwar Ali to Malan, 1 leg bye, and the slower ball, on leg stump, comes out right on cue. Malan goes for a pull, does not make contact, has to settle for leg byes",
5.1,"Zulfiqar Babar to Malan, 1 run, good footwork to get to the pitch of the ball outside leg stump, heaves it to deep midwicket.",
5.2,"Zulfiqar Babar to Mohammad Hafeez, no run, arm ball, in line with middle stump, asking for lbw. Hafeez does really well to pull his front leg back and block to square leg",
5.3,"Zulfiqar Babar to Mohammad Hafeez, 1 run, pushes his weight back and flicks a length ball through to deep midwicket",
5.4,"Zulfiqar Babar to Malan, 1 run, low full toss on leg stump, works it to midwicket",
5.5,"Zulfiqar Babar to Mohammad Hafeez, 1 run, gets down the track, but shapes to do so a touch too early. Zulfiqar shortens his length and therefore allows only a single through cover",
5.6,"Zulfiqar Babar to Malan, no run, tosses it up on middle, pushes it back down the ground and it gets tangled up in Hafeez's feet",
6.1,"Mohammad Nawaz to Mohammad Hafeez, 1 run, flat and outside off, cuts it past point",
6.2,"Mohammad Nawaz to Malan, SIX, poor bowling. it's short, it's down leg and it's been dispatched over square leg. All it needed is a simple swing of the bat and Malan gets under it to power it away",
6.3,"Mohammad Nawaz to Malan, 1 run, one-bounce to long-off as Malan backs away and slaps a short ball outside off straight to the fielder",
6.4,"Mohammad Nawaz to Mohammad Hafeez, SIX, top shot. There's no overhitting in Hafeez's game. It's all timing, and here he helps himself out by coming down the track and hitting it up and over with a straight bat",
6.5,"Mohammad Nawaz to Mohammad Hafeez, 1 run, shifts his weight back to a flatter delivery on middle and sends it to long-on. That's the fifty partnership off 34 balls",
6.6,"Mohammad Nawaz to Malan, FOUR, seems to be having problems gripping the ball. This too ends up short and wide and Malan thwacks it straight down the ground. Think he's concentrating a bit too much on bowling it flat and into the pitch",
7.1,"Hasan Khan to Mohammad Hafeez, 1 run, tries to play a late dab to a really full ball, just outside off, finds backward point",
7.2,"Hasan Khan to Malan, 2 runs, quick and full on middle, Malan slogs to deep square leg",
7.3,"Hasan Khan to Malan, FOUR, full toss on off stump, Malan drums it to long-on, power game coming into the fore",
7.4,"Hasan Khan to Malan, no run, finally, he slows it down, and Malan is well into his sweep shot. Easily beaten",
7.5,"Hasan Khan to Malan, 1 run, quick, flat, on leg stump, pulls it to deep square leg",
7.6,"Hasan Khan to Mohammad Hafeez, 1 run, comes down, making room, and seems to be deceived by the bowler lining it up wider outside off. Hafeez adjusts with his hands and finds a single through cover",
8.1,"Saad Nasim to Mohammad Hafeez, no run, shortish and outside off, cuts to point",
8.2,"Saad Nasim to Mohammad Hafeez, FOUR, they keep putting away the bad balls. This is goind down leg and Hafeez sweeps powerfully past short fine leg. Peshawar still in this, with their power hitters down the order. That's why Hafeez is playing sensible",
8.3,"Saad Nasim to Mohammad Hafeez, no run, pushes it through on middle, defends",
8.4,"Saad Nasim to Mohammad Hafeez, no run, cuts a ball he should be driving off the front foot and is beaten as a result",
8.5,"Saad Nasim to Mohammad Hafeez, 1 run, smacks a full toss outside off to the sweeper on the off side",
8.6,"Saad Nasim to Malan, FOUR, pulverises it through cover. Short and wide, giving him the freedom to hit through the line and imbue as much of his power as he likes. Malan says thank you. One more please?",
9.1,"Zulfiqar Babar to Mohammad Hafeez, SIX, tosses it up over the eyeline, and Hafeez likes this. Gets down on one knee and slog sweeps over midwicket. Vicious",
9.2,"Zulfiqar Babar to Mohammad Hafeez, 2 runs, does well, having rocked back to pull the ball, to realise it is skidding through low and he has to use a straighter bat. Whips it to the right of long-on",
9.3,"Zulfiqar Babar to Mohammad Hafeez, no run, low full toss, drives to cover. Hafeez annoyed he didn't get the gap",
9.4,"Zulfiqar Babar to Mohammad Hafeez, 1 run, flatter delivery on off stump, pushes it to long-on",
9.5,"Zulfiqar Babar to Malan, 1 run, loops it up outside off, drives to the right of cover",
9.6,"Zulfiqar Babar to Mohammad Hafeez, 1 run, tosses it up on middle, works it to long-on",
10.1,"Mills to Mohammad Hafeez, FOUR, picks the readymade gap at fine leg with Mills' wayward line down leg. The pace he puts on the ball works to the batsman's favour as he pulls well to the right of the man on the boundary",
10.2,"Mills to Mohammad Hafeez, 1 run, fuller delivery outside off, Hafeez goes for a cover drive and gets a thick outside edge to third man",
10.3,"Mills to Malan, 1 run, slower ball, full on middle, Malan drops and runs to point",
10.4,"Mills to Mohammad Hafeez, 1 run, down leg again, and Zulfiqar on the long leg boundary has been pushed fine and he does well to stop the leg glance from beating him on his right",
10.5,"Mills to Malan, FOUR, mid-off is up so hitting straight works. Short ball, outside off, skewed over the fielder and into the short boundary",
10.6,"Mills to Malan, FOUR, change of pace goes utterly wrong. It is short, sliding down leg and Malan pulls it to the long leg boundary. With the fielder up, that was basically a free hit.",
11.1,"Hasan Khan to Mohammad Hafeez, SIX, superb way to get to his first fifty of the PSL. Steps down, gets to the pitch of even a flatter ball outside off, and lifts it over long-off. His driving, especially straight, has been a treat",
11.2,"Hasan Khan to Mohammad Hafeez, SIX, so, even a good ball goes. Sees the batsman making room while he charges and pushes it wide of his reach. But Hafeez reaches out, doesn't over hit, and by virtue of that, has timed the pants off the ball over extra cover. Absolute class. That's the hundred partnership",
11.3,"Hasan Khan to Mohammad Hafeez, no run, shortish and outside off, cuts to point",
11.4,"Hasan Khan to Mohammad Hafeez, no run, pushes it through on middle and leg, sweeps and misses",
11.5,"Hasan Khan to Mohammad Hafeez, SIX, over long-on now. A little room given to free his arms and Hafeez gets under the ball and gives it the requisite air miles to disembark at the Peshawar dressing room",
11.6,"Hasan Khan to Mohammad Hafeez, 1 run, whips it through midwicket to retain strike. Took on the 18-year old, knowing he wouldn't have faced this kind of pressure, and came away with a 19-run over. Clever batting from the Professor",
12.1,"Zulfiqar Babar to Mohammad Hafeez, 1 run, full and outside off, Hafeez gets down low and scythes the ball towards backward point",
12.2,"Zulfiqar Babar to Malan, FOUR, this is just such delightful batting. There is no brute force. Everything is calculated. Everything is that much prettier. This is a low full toss on leg stump, Malan spots the mistake, gets down on one knee and scoops it over his right shoulder, banking on the short fine leg fielder not to catch up with it",
12.3,"Zulfiqar Babar to Malan, 1 run, full and wide, squeezes it out to cover",
12.4,"Zulfiqar Babar to Mohammad Hafeez, 1 run, full on off stump, Hafeez works it through to deep midwicket. That's the record for the highest partnership for Peshawar for any wicket - 124 unbroken",
12.5,"Zulfiqar Babar to Malan, 1 run, lashes an overpitched delivery outside off to long-off",
12.6,"Zulfiqar Babar to Mohammad Hafeez, 2 runs, shifts back to a length ball on off stump and clips it between midwicket and square leg on the boundary. Excellent shot",
13.1,"Mohammad Nawaz to Malan, FOUR, picks the gap at extra cover to bring up an excellent fifty. The fastest ever for Peshawar, off only 25 balls. A little width, and Malan hits it where it has the least chance of being stopped. There is only one man there and all he has to do is lift it over his head.",
13.2,"Mohammad Nawaz to Malan, 1 run, hacks it to deep midwicket",
13.3,"Mohammad Nawaz to Mohammad Hafeez, SIX, slog sweep, massive one again. The dew in the outfield is preventing the ball from spinning. Worse, it is making it come onto the bat, so Hafeez can play shots like this, across the line, against the turn",
13.4,"Mohammad Nawaz to Mohammad Hafeez, no run, dot ball. Very rare. Hafeez actually turns it into one, coming down the pitch and getting too close to the ball. Goes back to Nawaz",
13.5,"Mohammad Nawaz to Mohammad Hafeez, OUT, caught on the cover boundary. This is good bowling. He sees the batsman charging, and so pushes it through quicker and wider. Hafeez has to reach out while hitting the ball over the top. Toe-ends it and is caught very nicely, Nasim sliding to his right.",
13.6,"Mohammad Nawaz to Malan, 1 run, low full toss on leg stump, clips it to deep midwicket",['Mohammad Hafeez c Saad Nasim b Mohammad Nawaz 77 (47b 5x4 6x6) SR: 163.82']
14.1,"Anwar Ali to Malan, 1 run, fuller delivery on off stump, drags it to long-on",
14.2,"Anwar Ali to Shahid Afridi, 1 run, full and straight, flicks it right through KP at midwicket. Dreadful misfield",
14.3,"Anwar Ali to Malan, 1 run, he's through with a pull shot by the time the back of a length delivery actually arrives. Toe-end goes towards point",
14.4,"Anwar Ali to Shahid Afridi, no run, goes for the bouncer, on off stump, Afridi gets under it. Ooooh, he's fancying taking this deep",
14.5,"Anwar Ali to Shahid Afridi, FOUR, finds the gap! Not sure how, considering this slower ball is way wide outside off. Sweeps it over square leg - the man was up and that presented the opportunity. Anwar, if anything, bowls the wrong length - good length",
14.6,"Anwar Ali to Shahid Afridi, SIX, that's just pure power. Full tosses with ample room outside off don't need tender loving care. Blasts it over cover",
15.1,"Mills to Malan, OUT, oh, that's fantastic deception. This is sooooo slow. It's back of a length, and that triggers the batsman's instinct to pull, an instinct that is never easy to get the best of, which means you often play too early. That's why Mills is such a good bowler - he can repeat this ball when he is in form. Makes the batsman toe-end it right back to him for a simple catch. Malan tries to check his stroke, but he is too late",
15.2,"Mills to Haris Sohail, no run, back of a length and outside off, Sohail pokes outside off and is beaten. This is full pace.",
15.3,"Mills to Haris Sohail, no run, digs it in short on middle and off and makes Sohail sway away from its line",['DJ Malan c & b Mills 56 (30b 8x4 1x6) SR: 186.66']
15.4,"Mills to Haris Sohail, 1 run, picks the slower, shorter ball, and pulls to deep square leg",
15.5,"Mills to Shahid Afridi, SIX, bashes it over cover again and we have another ball will not be found. On the roof. Mills bowls fast, and into the slot and Afridi swings free. This isn't slogging. This is clean hitting.",
15.6,"Mills to Shahid Afridi, 2 runs, fuller delivery on middle, from around the wicket, flicks it through to the right of deep square leg for a couple",
16.1,"Mohammad Nawaz to Haris Sohail, FOUR, through the fielder at cover, that's dreadful and Sarfraz the captain is down on his knees. He tried to hide Zulfiqar, one of the slowest movers, inside the circle and Sohail picks him out with a full toss",
16.2,"Mohammad Nawaz to Haris Sohail, 1 run, pushes it down to long-on as Sharjah roars ""La-la! La-la! La-la!""",
16.3,"Mohammad Nawaz to Shahid Afridi, 1 run, shortish and outside off, cuts to point",
16.4,"Mohammad Nawaz to Haris Sohail, OUT, good work. He keeps it full, it's straight, Sohail hits right across the line with a slog sweep. The ball is turning into him, but he chooses the wrong one to try and get under. Yorks himself",
16.5,"Mohammad Nawaz to Sammy, 1 run, lifts a fuller delivery over cover",
16.6,"Mohammad Nawaz to Shahid Afridi, SIX, into the crowd at long-off. Charges down the pitch - what a sickening sight that must be for a bowler - and deposits a good length ball outside off over the boundary and into a clump of his rabid fans",
17.1,"Mills to Sammy, 1 run, back of a length and outside off, drills it through to deep cover",
17.2,"Mills to Shahid Afridi, 1 run, full on off stump, defends and picks the single to deep cover",['Haris Sohail b Mohammad Nawaz 6 (6b 1x4 0x6) SR: 100.00']
17.3,"Mills to Sammy, no run, goes for a bouncer just outside off, Sammy shoulders arms",
17.4,"Mills to Sammy, 1 run, whips it away off his pads to long leg, who suffers a little fumble",
17.5,"Mills to Shahid Afridi, 1 run, back of a length, with all the pace drawn off it, Afridi dabs it to long leg",
17.6,"Mills to Sammy, 1 run, shortish and outside off, carves it up and over point",
18.1,"Anwar Ali to Sammy, no run, beats the right-hander with a good length ball that nibbles just enough away off the pitch",
18.2,"Anwar Ali to Sammy, 1 run, short ball, drags it from outside off with a pull to deep midwicket",
18.3,"Anwar Ali to Shahid Afridi, SIX, tonks it again. It's length, and Afridi gets under it to send the ball soaring into the crowd again, this time beyond long-on",
18.4,"Anwar Ali to Shahid Afridi, no run, short ball, outside off, Afridi loads up the pull, but misses",
18.5,"Anwar Ali to Shahid Afridi, OUT, this is high, this will need some catching and Nawaz takes a blinder. Change of pace works for Anwar and Quetta. Afridi thinks this is simply a length ball and so swings into the leg side. Ends up mistiming it and the fielder at deep midwicket takes it nervelessly. Would have had his heart thudding somewhere near his throat for at least two minutes - that's how long the ball was in the air",
18.6,"Anwar Ali to Sammy, 1 run, short and wide outside off, cut to deep point to retain strike",
19.1,"Mohammad Nawaz to Sammy, no run, nails the blockhole outside off, Sammy jams his bat down, finds cover. Tiny misfield, but it doesn't cost Quetta",
19.2,"Mohammad Nawaz to Sammy, FOUR, short third man goes for the catch, running back, but he is unable to hold on. A big miscue from Sammy, and the outside edge bounces off the right hand of Tymal Mills and onto the boundary",
19.3,"Mohammad Nawaz to Sammy, 1 run, tosses it up outside off, Sammy looks to smear it through cover but gets an inside edge to fine leg",
19.4,"Mohammad Nawaz to Jordan, OUT, caught behind. Great take from Sarfraz. This is a flatter delivery outside off, Jordan tries a cut and feathers an edge through to the Quetta captain to keep up the tension",['Shahid Afridi c Mohammad Nawaz b Anwar Ali 34 (13b 1x4 4x6) SR: 261.53']
19.5,"Mohammad Nawaz to Wahab Riaz, OUT, he's gone! Quetta are cock a hoop! This is a yorker. Wahab flicks and just about saves himself from being bowled. But then looking all around, he can't see the ball, he thinks he's hit it away somewhere and goes for a run. Except the ball is right there, bouncing into Sarfraz's gloves, and he takes off the stumps with glee",
19.6,"Mohammad Nawaz to Hasan Ali, OUT, Quetta have won it! Nawaz you absolute beauty! With a wet ball, with massive dew around, with great pressure on him, he bowls the yorker, he trusts himself to bowl the yorker. Hasan digs it out and overbalances. He tries to make his crease again, sees Sarfraz pick up the ball, and then bizarrely tries to run. After that, it was basic for the wicketkeeper to topple the stumps",
