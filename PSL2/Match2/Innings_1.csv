0.1,"Sohail Tanvir to Asad Shafiq, no run, starts on a full length, gets his natural away movement. Easily played into the off side, towards cover",
0.2,"Sohail Tanvir to Asad Shafiq, 1 run, a tad straighter, still full. Not much swing. Just a little bit of away seam movement, outside-edged down to third man",
0.3,"Sohail Tanvir to Ahmed Shehzad, 1 run, nice stroke. A tad short this time, short and wide. Scythed down to third man for a run. Played that late",
0.4,"Sohail Tanvir to Asad Shafiq, 1 run",
0.5,"Sohail Tanvir to Ahmed Shehzad, 1 run, good stuff. Full again, in a good channel just outside off, carved down to third man with an angled bat",
0.6,"Sohail Tanvir to Asad Shafiq, no run, straying down leg, rapped on the pad. Full delivery on Shafiq's pads, he fails to make contact. An optimistic appeal is quickly aborted",
1.1,"Mohammad Irfan to Ahmed Shehzad, no run, a bit of a whirry action. Full and straight to start, defended towards mid-off",
1.2,"Mohammad Irfan to Ahmed Shehzad, 1 leg bye, on the pads again, Shehzad misses a flick. Off the pad towards square leg",
1.3,"Mohammad Irfan to Asad Shafiq, 1 run, too straight yet again, worked away through square leg for one",
1.4,"Mohammad Irfan to Ahmed Shehzad, 1 run, lovely line, but well played too. Full and straight, prodded away towards cover for a quick run",
1.5,"Mohammad Irfan to Asad Shafiq, FOUR, goes over mid-on this time. Again, full. Again, straight. Predictable. Shafiq goes up and over mid-on. Easy",
1.6,"Mohammad Irfan to Asad Shafiq, no run, looks to go over again, fails to time it. Full outside off. Shafiq mis-times his drive to mid-off",
2.1,"Sohail Tanvir to Ahmed Shehzad, no run, nice line, nagging away around off, blocked",
2.2,"Sohail Tanvir to Ahmed Shehzad, 2 runs, good length around middle, jabbed to midwicket for a couple. But is he quick enough? Shafiq needed a full-length dive and that saved him. Kept the bat face pointing up. Good effort from Shafiq.",
2.3,"Sohail Tanvir to Ahmed Shehzad, OUT, given! A bouncer down leg, Shehzad tries to get outside the line and help the ball down to fine leg. But can't get bat on his stroke, just glove.

2.4,"Sohail Tanvir to Pietersen, 2 runs, comes down to Tanvir and flamingo-flicks him through midwicket for a couple. Proactive stuff from KP. Lovely shot, great timing",
2.5,"Sohail Tanvir to Pietersen, 1 leg bye, big appeal. On the pads, KP misses a flick, the ball ricochets towards short fine leg. Pitched way outside leg",
2.6,"Sohail Tanvir to Asad Shafiq, no run, full and wide outside off, slapped away with bad timing to cover.",
3.1,"Narine to Pietersen, no run, the carrom ball to start. Full outside off, KP looks to turn the ball through midwicket, but gets a leading edge to cover",

3.3,"Narine to Pietersen, 1 run, a touch straighter and fuller, Pietersen nails his sweep to deep backward square leg",
3.4,"Narine to Asad Shafiq, FOUR, a slog sweep! Tossed up on off, Shafiq gets low and pounces all over his sweep. Just beats midwicket, the fielder at the boundary makes a mess of his dive",
3.5,"Narine to Asad Shafiq, no run, gives himself room this time, full and straight, hit away to mid-off. Bad timing",
3.6,"Narine to Asad Shafiq, no run, gets waaay outside off stump and misses his sweep. The bowling team inexplicably goes up in appeal. No run",
4.1,"Mohammad Irfan to Pietersen, no run, nicely played. Full delivery outside off, hit up to mid-off with great timing. Doesn't find the gap",
4.2,"Mohammad Irfan to Pietersen, OUT, inside-edged into the stumps. A massive wicket. Pietersen runs at the bowler and wipes his bat through the line. There is a bit of inward seam movement though and the ball takes the inside edge and whacks leg stump. One of the Gladiators' best batsman.",
4.3,"Mohammad Irfan to Rossouw, 1 run, good length outside off, pushed away towards cover from the crease",['KP Pietersen b Mohammad Irfan 3 (7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 42.85']

4.5,"Mohammad Irfan to Asad Shafiq, no run, full outside off, comes down again and drives hard to mid-off",
4.6,"Mohammad Irfan to Asad Shafiq, no run, lovely change in pace. A slower delivery on middle, Shafiq is way too early through his pull and is hit on the body. Clever bowling",
5.1,"Narine to Rossouw, no run, flat and wide, driven away towards point",
5.2,"Narine to Rossouw, 1 run, drops short on off, Rossouw goes back and slaps his pull to mid-on. A naughty fumble allows one",

5.5,"Narine to Rossouw, 1 run, a good single, push and run to cover",

6.2,"Bilawal Bhatti to Asad Shafiq, no run, runs down at the bowler. Good length on middle, Shafiq advances and mis-times a pull back to the bowler. Looking for muscle, not timing, not his strength",
6.3,"Bilawal Bhatti to Asad Shafiq, FOUR, he'll get four this time. Not the greatest looking stroke. A slower bouncer outside off, Shafiq gets a top edge which flies in the gap at backward square leg",
6.4,"Bilawal Bhatti to Asad Shafiq, no run, good length on off, hammered back to the bowler",
6.5,"Bilawal Bhatti to Asad Shafiq, 1 run, no run there. What? Short and wide, pushed to short cover. Shafiq calls for one, puts his partner in jeopardy too. The fielder misses the stumps at the bowler's end. Out by a distance if he hit",
6.6,"Bilawal Bhatti to Rossouw, 2 runs, bat goes over square leg. Waaaatch out! The third umpire is called for. The ball went somewhere towards midwicket. While everyone was looking at the bat, the batsmen complete two. The bat handle is in Rossouw's hand, the rest of his bat isn't. They have plenty of replacements these days. Rossouw's foot is inside the crease, plenty of replays.",
7.1,"Yasir Shah to Asad Shafiq, FOUR, that's better from Shafiq. Stick to his strengths. One of them is his touch. He gets low and reverse-paddles the ball down to the third man boundary. Fantastic",

7.3,"Yasir Shah to Rossouw, 1 run, tossed up outside off, drilled down to long-off",

8.5,"Bilawal Bhatti to Asad Shafiq, 2 runs, there goes McCullum with an acrobatic dive. A low full toss outside off, driven wide of cover for a couple. Just out of reach of Baz",
8.6,"Bilawal Bhatti to Asad Shafiq, 1 run, bad delivery. Short down leg, pulled down to fine leg for one. Lucky to get away with that",
9.1,"Narine to Asad Shafiq, OUT, and gets a wicket with his first ball. Full and straight from Narine, Shafiq gets low, looks to paddle the ball down to fine leg. Fails to make any connection and the stumps light up. A struggling innings ends",

9.5,"Narine to Rossouw, 1 run, a tad full this time, drilled down to long-off",
9.6,"Narine to Sarfraz Ahmed, OUT, huge wicket this. Sarfraz goes. Slow delivery outside off, it's short too. Sarfraz sees the length and decides to cut. The offbreak rips in, takes the inside edge and then clatters into the stumps. Poor shot selection. Excellent captaincy from McCullum to have Narine bowl one here.",
10.1,"Yasir Shah to Rossouw, 1 run, Rossouw runs down and heaves one to deep midwicket. Not great timing",
10.2,"Yasir Shah to Mohammad Nawaz, no run, well bowled. Pushed wide outside off, Nawaz leaves.",

11.3,"Elliott to Rossouw, 1 run, driven away to deep cover for one",
11.4,"Elliott to Perera, 1 run, another offcutter outside off, so slow. Inside-edged towards midwicket. Pace off ruling the contest",
11.5,"Elliott to Rossouw, 1 run, well bowled. Pace off again, the ball stops on Rossouw, a checked drive makes its way to midwicket. So slow this surface",['Mohammad Nawaz (3) run out 1 (3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33']
