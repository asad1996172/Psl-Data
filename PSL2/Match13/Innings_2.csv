0.6,"Imad Wasim to Kamran Akmal, no run, nicely bowled. Kamran backs away and the bowler follows him with a fuller delivery on leg stump. Akmal tries to force it through the off side and does not make contact",

2.3,"Imad Wasim to Tamim Iqbal, 1 run, bowls it with pace and short of good length, punched off the backfoot down to long-on",
2.4,"Imad Wasim to Kamran Akmal, no run, backs away and tries to cut this one but the bowler follows him and gets it to slide in with the arm. Akmal works it to extra cover",

2.6,"Imad Wasim to Kamran Akmal, SIX, and this one's a lot more convincing. Poor delivery, full and width outside off. Akmal launches a straight missile over long-off and the ball sails into the ground. Sixteen off that over and this must break the shackles",
3.1,"Sohail Khan to Tamim Iqbal, no run, good length, some bounce and getting it to nip away, lands on the seam and cuts away, beats the outside edge of the flashing blade of Tamim",
3.2,"Sohail Khan to Tamim Iqbal, FOUR, Tamim gives the charge and takes this wider ball on the full, enough room, so he is able to free his arms and crunch it straight down the ground. Minimises the movement by coming down the ground",

3.4,"Sohail Khan to Kamran Akmal, OUT, short of good length ball, Akmal swipes hard and it seems like he has played that pull shot to perfection. Gets it off the middle of the bat but just not enough distance. That's the longer boundary there. Ravi Bopara guarding the deep backward square leg fence and he snaffles it without having to move an inch. Straight down his throat",['Kamran Akmal c Bopara b Sohail Khan 14 (12b 1x4 1x6) SR: 116.66']

3.6,"Sohail Khan to Tamim Iqbal, OUT, that's a peach. Fires a tempter outside off and Tamim falls for the bait. Strides dangerously out and the angle takes the ball away from the left-hander.

4.2,"Imad Wasim to Iftikhar Ahmed, OUT, stays in the crease and tries to punch this short of good length ball through the off side. He gets beaten as the ball goes to the wicketkeeper. Or has he? Appeal for caught behind and umpire Aleem Dar takes forever before raising the finger. Went off the inside edge that one. Lack of room does him in",

5.6,"Sohail Khan to Morgan, no run, raps him on the pads with a length ball and Morgan fails to tuck it away. Appeal for lbw but it is more optimistic than anything. Clearly pitching outside leg. Just the second maiden over of the PSL",

6.2,"Usama Mir to Morgan, no run, punched from the crease to mid-on who runs in and fields it",

7.1,"Shoaib Malik to Morgan, 1 run, full and angling in on leg, clipped away to the leg side",
7.2,"Shoaib Malik to Shakib Al Hasan, no run, backs away and the bowler does well to follow him. It straightens after landing on a length and beats the attempted flick",
7.3,"Shoaib Malik to Shakib Al Hasan, 1 run, tucked away to short fine leg",
7.4,"Shoaib Malik to Morgan, OUT, Morgan's last outing with Peshawar will not be one he savours. Pitched right up on the stumps and Morgan tries to clear the front leg and go big over the leg side. Picks out Ravi Bopara at wide long-on who pouches it reverse-cupped. Peshawar in all sorts of trouble here. Morgan trudges off having faced 13 balls for his 3",
7.5,"Shoaib Malik to Shakib Al Hasan, FOUR, turn and bounce from the length region. Gets it to grip on the surface and the sharp turn means Shakib is clueless and skews it inadvertently off the outside edge as the ball beats short third man to the boundary. Malik is standing there scratching his head. That certainly did not deserve four",
7.6,"Shoaib Malik to Shakib Al Hasan, no run, defended back to the bowler",
8.1,"Usama Mir to Sohaib Maqsood, 1 run, short of a length and turning away, punched off the backfoot to long-on",['EJG Morgan c Bopara b Shoaib Malik 3 (13b 0x4 0x6) SR: 23.07']
8.2,"Usama Mir to Shakib Al Hasan, FOUR, full toss, swept away hard and the ball races away to the deep midwicket fence in the blink of an eye",
8.3,"Usama Mir to Shakib Al Hasan, no run, tries to back away and cut but the room isn't quite there. Beats the bat and narrowly misses off-stump",

8.6,"Usama Mir to Sohaib Maqsood, FOUR, pitched up outside off, lot of room on offer. Maqsood lofts and easily clears the in-field on the off-side. Sweeper cover runs to his right but has no chance of getting to that",
9.1,"Usman Khan to Shakib Al Hasan, 1 run, short of a length, pulled past the diving midwicket fielder. There is a fielder at long-on who is placed slightly wide and he runs across and fields it",
9.2,"Usman Khan to Sohaib Maqsood, no run, good length, attacking the stumps, Maqsood presses forward and knocks it back to the bowler",
9.3,"Usman Khan to Sohaib Maqsood, OUT, Kieron Pollard does it like only Kieron Pollard can. Man is this guy a genius or what! Full and angling in on the stumps, Maqsood lofts it straight down the ground and that never seemed like it was going to carry the distance. He did not have enough room to free his arms. Pollard takes it reverse-cupped inches in front of the ropes. The momentum takes him back as he was getting in position to take it and he does well to keep the foot inside the line. And makes it look like he took it in his sleep",
9.4,"Usman Khan to Sammy, no run, quicker from Usman. Sammy is beaten by pace. It skids on as it cuts back in sharply from the short of good length and raps Sammy on the pads. But the angle suggests it was heading down leg. And given how short it was, height may also have been an issue",
9.5,"Usman Khan to Sammy, 2 runs, tucked off the pads into the vacant midwicket region and they hurry back for the second",
9.6,"Usman Khan to Sammy, 1 run, good length, angling in on the stumps, tucked away to midwicket. There is a fielder in the deep and it will only be one",

10.2,"Usama Mir to Sammy, no run, tries to go big over the leg side and nearly gets an outside edge that goes to Gayle who takes it well. Turned a mile",
10.3,"Usama Mir to Sammy, 1 run, short and wide, slapped out to sweeper cover",
10.4,"Usama Mir to Shakib Al Hasan, 1 run, flighted and on a length, stays in the crease and tucks it behind square for a single",
10.5,"Usama Mir to Sammy, no run, comes forward and defends back to the bowler",
10.6,"Usama Mir to Sammy, SIX, that is just raw power. Flighted and pitched up outside off and Sammy has absolutely flayed it. It goes flat and hard and comfortably sails over the head of long-off who does not bother going up",
11.1,"Usman Khan to Shakib Al Hasan, no run, comes down the track very early and ends up getting beaten as he swings loosely",
11.2,"Usman Khan to Shakib Al Hasan, OUT, straight down the throat of long-on. Like Karachi earlier, Peshawar are struggling to clear the boundary. Shakib pulls this short of a length ball and there is a lot of muscle on the shot. Does not get the elevation or the distance as Bopara takes it comfortably",
11.3,"Usman Khan to Shahid Afridi, no run, short ball, ducked under",
11.4,"Usman Khan to Shahid Afridi, no run, walks across to protect off-stump. Usman gets extra bounce from the good length region and it is turned away to midwicket",
11.5,"Usman Khan to Shahid Afridi, no run, well-directed short ball, Afridi ducks under",
11.6,"Usman Khan to Shahid Afridi, 1 run, no, we won't. Good length ball, stays in the crease before quietly nudging it away towards mid-on",
12.1,"Mohammad Amir to Shahid Afridi, 1 run, opens the bat face and steers it to square third man",['Shakib Al Hasan c Bopara b Usman Khan 18 (16b 3x4 0x6) SR: 112.50']
12.2,"Mohammad Amir to Sammy, 1 run, short of a length ball outside off, jabs it with a flat bat down to long-off",
12.3,"Mohammad Amir to Shahid Afridi, SIX, full, wide, room on offer, Afridi frees his arms and crashes it over covers. That's brute power, clean, flat hit",
12.4,"Mohammad Amir to Shahid Afridi, 1 leg bye, fuller and on the pads, tries to clip it away forcefully and wears it on the pads",
12.5,"Mohammad Amir to Sammy, 1 run, full and wide, thumped hard off the backfoot by Sammy and long-off runs to his right and collects it one-bounce. That must have stung, was travelling real quick",
12.6,"Mohammad Amir to Shahid Afridi, SIX, Afridi pummels another fuller one with a flat bat and the ball sails over long-off, clears the boundary with ease",
13.1,"Usman Khan to Sammy, no run, full and outside off, angling in, Sammy whips it with the angle but picks out midwicket",

13.4,"Usman Khan to Shahid Afridi, FOUR, very full ball, went for the yorker, it's actually a pretty good delivery but that is the incredible power of Shahid Afridi. Drills it hard, off the bottom of the bat, and the ball goes to the long-off boundary. Mid-off is slightly up and no chance for him to get his hands on that",
13.5,"Usman Khan to Shahid Afridi, 1 run, fullish outside off, drilled down to long-off",
13.6,"Usman Khan to Sammy, 1 run, goes for a yorker and attacks the stumps but it is a low full toss that is driven out to sweeper cover",
14.1,"Mohammad Amir to Sammy, 1 leg bye, short of a length, tries to tuck off the pads behind square and wears it on the pads instead",
14.2,"Mohammad Amir to Shahid Afridi, 1 run, fends it away to short third man",
14.3,"Mohammad Amir to Sammy, 1 run, length on off, Sammy pummels it down to long-off and the ball goes on the bounce to the fielder there",
14.4,"Mohammad Amir to Shahid Afridi, FOUR, swipes with the angle and looks to go through the leg side. Gets a thick inside edge and it goes through the legs to the fine leg boundary. Can't do anything about that",
14.5,"Mohammad Amir to Shahid Afridi, 1 run, tries to back away and flays it with a flat bat over the umpire's head and the ball lands on the bounce in front of long-off",
14.6,"Mohammad Amir to Sammy, no run, short ball, tries to maul this away to the leg side and does not make contact",
15.1,"Sohail Khan to Shahid Afridi, SIX, you don't bowl there to Afridi. Length ball, angling in from over the wicket and Afridi uses the angle to launch it into the night sky and that has gone miles into the air and clears the deep midwicket boundary",
15.2,"Sohail Khan to Shahid Afridi, 1 run",
15.3,"Sohail Khan to Sammy, 1 leg bye, slower ball, good chance of pace, Sammy completes the shot early as he tries to whip it away through the leg side and gets an inside edge to the pads",
15.4,"Sohail Khan to Shahid Afridi, no run, slower short ball, Afridi is beaten by the lack of pace",
15.5,"Sohail Khan to Shahid Afridi, no run, short ball, ducked under. Afridi was hoping for it to be called a wide but the umpire thinks it's fine. Afridi looks to the square leg umpire and doesn't look happy. And he gets a tutorial from Chris Gayle, who is next to the umpire, on the height allowed on bouncers",
15.6,"Sohail Khan to Shahid Afridi, no run, short ball, tries to pull it away and does not make contact",
16.1,"Mohammad Amir to Sammy, no run, tries to flick it away to the leg side and gets a leading edge to the bowler, drops short of Amir",
16.2,"Mohammad Amir to Sammy, SIX, short ball, sits up nicely for Sammy who swivels around and pulls, dispatches it over the deep square leg boundary",
16.3,"Mohammad Amir to Sammy, FOUR, goes for the pull shot again but this one bounces more considerably, more than to his comfort and he gets a top edge on the pull as the ball goes over the keeper's head and on the bounce over the boundary",
16.4,"Mohammad Amir to Sammy, 1 run, fuller ball, crashes it through extra cover and sweeper cover moves to his right and cuts it off",
16.5,"Mohammad Amir to Shahid Afridi, 1 run, yorker on leg stump, Afridi jams the bat down and digs it out into the leg side",
16.6,"Mohammad Amir to Sammy, 1 leg bye, another yorker and Sammy misses as he tries to turn it away to the leg side. Gets hit on the pad. Appeal from Amir but that hit him a mile outside leg",
17.1,"Sohail Khan to Sammy, 1 run, full toss from Sohail and Sammy tries to flay it away over the leg side, gets a leading edge that lobs towards point who charges forward and dives but it drops in front of him. Great effort though",
17.2,"Sohail Khan to Shahid Afridi, SIX, and Afridi's assault continues. Backs away early and actually gets more leg side of the ball than he would have liked, so he has to reach out for it quite a bit. It was the back-of-the-hand slower one and Afridi still manages to clear point boundary as he lofts it square of the wicket",
17.3,"Sohail Khan to Shahid Afridi, 1 run, backs away and Sohail follows him with a fuller ball that is pushed down to long-on",
17.4,"Sohail Khan to Sammy, SIX, that's outta here. They just changed the ball and seems like we already may need a new one. That's 91 metres, Ramiz Raja says on air. Sohail's attempt at a yorker goes horribly wrong as he shovels this straight, over long-on and out of the ground",
17.5,"Sohail Khan to Sammy, OUT, oh, what drama! Sammy cannot believe it. Stands in the crease and has his hands on his head. It was a short of a length ball and Sammy was swivelling around and looking to dispatch it fine. But he needed to get it a lot finer with short fine leg in place, does not do so and Gayle takes the catch. Seemed like it crashed into his chest as he rubs it. Still is as the new man comes in. Oh, yes, it hits him on the chest, bounces up and he takes the rebound",
17.6,"Sohail Khan to Wahab Riaz, 1 run, backs away and crunches this full toss to extra cover",
18.1,"Usman Khan to Wahab Riaz, 1 run, run-out chance and the bowler has made a mess of it. What's more, he has hurt his neck as he crashes face first into the shoulder of Wahab running to the striker's end. That looked nasty. It was fuller outside off and Wahab drilled it back towards the bowler. They take off for the single and there is a yes and no. Usman tries to run towards his end and collides with Wahab running across to the right. The batsman gets back",
18.2,"Usman Khan to Shahid Afridi, FOUR, misfield, and Pollard of all people. Pollard rushes into the ball which is driven hard towards long-off, probably slightly overran. Intention was to prevent the second run but he lets it slip past him and into the boundary",
18.3,"Usman Khan to Shahid Afridi, 1 run, yorker outside off, flashes hard and the ball goes off the inside part of the bat to short fine leg",
18.4,"Usman Khan to Wahab Riaz, OUT, leg stump taken out. Wahab was backing away and ends up exposing all three stumps. Bulls-eye by the bowler as he fires a yorker. Wahab swings wildly and Usman hits",
18.5,"Usman Khan to Hasan Ali, no run, beautifully bowled. Yorker outside off and it is drilled down to midwicket off the inside part of the bat. They don't take the run. Afridi, perhaps thinking it was the last ball of the over does not take the single. Seems like the umpires have made a mistake when Afridi was checking with them about balls remaining",
18.6,"Usman Khan to Hasan Ali, FOUR, you know what! Doesn't matter if they did not take the single the previous ball because it is a fabulous end to the over. Moves across the stumps and scoops it past the diving wicketkeeper to the fine leg boundary. Fantastic skill and great execution",
19.1,"Usama Mir to Shahid Afridi, 2 runs, gets down for a slog sweep and gets it off the inside part of the bat to fine leg. Gayle makes a lazy effort at fine leg, sticking a boot out instead of getting down and using his hands. Allows the extra run and Afridi to come back for the second",
19.2,"Usama Mir to Shahid Afridi, no run, flat on middle and leg, tries to slog against the turn and inside-edges it to the thigh",
19.3,"Usama Mir to Shahid Afridi, SIX, Afridi keeps Peshwar's hopes alive and their hearts racing. Straighter ball and Afridi slogs it over deep midwicket and it has gone a long way into the stands",
19.4,"Usama Mir to Shahid Afridi, OUT, Afridi's highly entertaining, equally valuable innings comes to an end after a slog gone awry. Chris Gayle makes amends for his earlier lapse by running to his left and taking a good catch. Afridi skews it off the splice to the backward square leg region and Gayle moves like he has never moved to take that",['Wahab Riaz b Usman Khan 2 (3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 66.66']
19.5,"Usama Mir to Hasan Ali, OUT, and this is how it ends. Fittingly, Bopara, who has arguably been the best fielder of the night takes the catch at long-off. Hasan was looking to loft it and ends up skying it but does not get the distance desired. Bopara runs forward and slides to pluck another superb catch. Sammy and the rest of Peshawar look dejected, jubilation within the Karachi camp",
