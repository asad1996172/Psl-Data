0.1,"Hasan Ali to Babar Azam, no run, some carry and bounce straight away as he begins with a bouncer that is ducked by Babar",
0.2,"Hasan Ali to Babar Azam, FOUR, oh, nearly chopped on. Lucky boundary to get going. Babar slashes at this wide delivery. Wide half-volley, gets an inside edge that misses the stumps and goes away into the fine leg boundary",
0.3,"Hasan Ali to Babar Azam, FOUR, bowls this much straighter and Babar walks across the stumps before tucking it through the square leg region",
0.4,"Hasan Ali to Babar Azam, no run, that's more like it. Tempter outside off and Babar comes forward and sticks his bat out, gets beaten for his troubles",
0.5,"Hasan Ali to Babar Azam, no run, comes forward to meet this length ball outside off and drops it into the covers region. Thinks of a single and starts off but is sent back",
0.6,"Hasan Ali to Babar Azam, no run, short of a length on off and holding its line, stands tall and punches off the backfoot back to the bowler",
1.1,"Wahab Riaz to Sangakkara, 1 run, fuller ball on middle stump and coming on straight, clipped off the pads wide of mid-on for a quick single",
1.2,"Wahab Riaz to Babar Azam, no run, short of good length and angling away outside off, stays in the crease and punches off the backfoot to the covers region",
1.3,"Wahab Riaz to Babar Azam, FOUR, full and wide outside off, offers up just enough width outside off for the batsman to free his arms. Babr just takes a stride across towards the off-stump before crashing it past mid-off",
1.4,"Wahab Riaz to Babar Azam, no run, full and angling away outside off, drops it in front of point where it is fielded cleanly. No run there",
1.5,"Wahab Riaz to Babar Azam, SIX, drags the length back and that's quite an effortless shot. Gets in position early, head firm as he lays into a pull shot and the ball sails over the deep midwicket boundary. Sat up nicely and Babar is in such tremendous form, he's not going to miss out on capitalising on those",
1.6,"Wahab Riaz to Babar Azam, no run, sticks his bat out and opens the face to run it down towards third man without any feet and cannot put bat to ball",
2.1,"Hasan Ali to Sangakkara, 2 runs, fullish length ball, tucked off the pads wide of deep midwicket and the fielder there runs across and picks it up",
2.2,"Hasan Ali to Sangakkara, 1 run, tucked off the pads to deep midwicket",
2.3,"Hasan Ali to Babar Azam, no run, good length, angling in from outside off, stays in the crease and presents a straight bat as he jabs it towards mid-on",
2.4,"Hasan Ali to Babar Azam, FOUR, slower short ball and that's sloppy work from Imran Khan jnr at short fine leg. Babar was swivelling around and pulling it, didn't try to hit it too hard and placement was going to be key. He does not get it wide enough of the fielder there but gets a boundary nonetheless thanks to the misfield",
2.5,"Hasan Ali to Babar Azam, no run, defended back to the bowler",
2.6,"Hasan Ali to Babar Azam, 1 run, turns it away from outside off straight to mid-on, didn't hit it too hard so the ball does not go to the fielder as quickly. But it is still a sharp single, called for it straightaway and completes it easily in the end",
3.1,"Shakib Al Hasan to Babar Azam, FOUR, flights it but does not get it as full as he would have liked, drops it slightly short and width outside off. Nice bounce on the surface and Babar pulls it away between midwicket and long-on",
3.2,"Shakib Al Hasan to Babar Azam, 1 run, works it down to long-off to follow up the boundary with a single",
3.3,"Shakib Al Hasan to Sangakkara, no run, cuts this short ball off the backfoot but cannot pierce point",
3.4,"Shakib Al Hasan to Sangakkara, 1 run, eased down to long-on",
3.5,"Shakib Al Hasan to Babar Azam, 2 runs, comes down the track and looks to go big over the leg side but does not get the timing right and the ball lands on the bounce in front of deep midwicket fielder",
3.6,"Shakib Al Hasan to Babar Azam, 1 run, worked wide of mid-on",
4.1,"Imran Khan to Babar Azam, 1 run, shorter in length, worked out to deep midwicket",
4.2,"Imran Khan to Sangakkara, 1 run, slower ball wide outside off, tucks it away to the leg side, to the midwicket region. That one had no pace on it",
4.3,"Imran Khan to Babar Azam, 1 run, very slow length ball outside off, comes forward and drops it into the off side",
4.4,"Imran Khan to Sangakkara, 1 run, short of good length, much quicket at 124 clicks this time and it is pulled through square leg. Deep midwicket runs across and collects it",
4.5,"Imran Khan to Babar Azam, FOUR, whipped away off the pads through square leg and he has played that well enough for the ball to comfortably beat the deep midwicket fielder running to his right. Jumps back and moves across to use the depth of the crease to that one",
4.6,"Imran Khan to Babar Azam, 1 run, similarly jumps back and whips it off the pads but this time to the man at deep midwicket",
5.1,"Wahab Riaz to Babar Azam, no run, sprayed down the leg side, or has it? Babar misses the glance but Babar was walking into the stumps and the umpire thinks it goes over leg stump",
5.2,"Wahab Riaz to Babar Azam, 1 run, good length ball on off, jumps back and across and uses the wrists to flick it away to backward square leg. They momentarily think of the second but decide against it",
5.3,"Wahab Riaz to Sangakkara, 1 run, opens up at the sight of some width outside off and carves it through the backward point region. Third man is placed square and he runs across to collect it",
5.4,"Wahab Riaz to Babar Azam, no run, fuller and on the pads, tries to tuck it away off the pads but cannot beat backward square leg",
5.5,"Wahab Riaz to Babar Azam, no run, flashes his blade outside off and gets beaten in the channel",
5.6,"Wahab Riaz to Babar Azam, no run, full and wide, good yorker well outside off, around a set of stumps wide, jams the bat down and does not manage to squeeze it out",
6.1,"Sammy to Sangakkara, FOUR, that's such a loosener. Full and harmlessly coming on the pads and it is clipped away elegantly through backward square leg",
6.2,"Sammy to Sangakkara, FOUR, on the leg stump channel this time but this time it's slightly shorter in length. Sangakkara tucks it beautifully off the pads through square leg. Exquisite timing, that was silken",
6.3,"Sammy to Sangakkara, FOUR, manipulates the field well, sees the packed leg side field and capitalises on some width outside off. Deliberately plays it of the splice by opening the bat face late and the ball goes past the third man region",
6.4,"Sammy to Sangakkara, 2 runs, punched elegantly off the backfoot wide of sweeper cover",
6.5,"Sammy to Sangakkara, 1 run, length ball outside off, stays in the crease and punches it down to long-off",
6.6,"Sammy to Babar Azam, 1 run, slower short of a length ball, rolls his fingers over the seam and it is pulled away through the midwicket region. Sammy's return to bowling in this PSL proves costly",
7.1,"Shahid Afridi to Babar Azam, no run, comes forward and punches this fuller ball to the off side. Sammy gets down to stop it and seems like he has hurt himself. He is up and limping but seems okay",
7.2,"Shahid Afridi to Babar Azam, 2 runs, floated up outside off and Azam comes forward and crunches a drive through extra cover. Sohaib Maqsood wwith a brilliant stop, running to his right from sweeper cover and putting in a well-timed dive to keep the ball from crossing the ropes",
7.3,"Shahid Afridi to Babar Azam, no run, punched off the backfoot back to the bowler",
7.4,"Shahid Afridi to Babar Azam, no run, comes forward and pushes this into the off side and Afridi hurries across on the follow-through and picks it up",
7.5,"Shahid Afridi to Babar Azam, 2 runs, shorter ball, pulled away between deep midwicket and long-on. Shakib and Wahab converge on the ball and both of them put in the dive. One misses the ball but the other, diving behind, manages to stop it",
7.6,"Shahid Afridi to Babar Azam, no run, tries to crunch this through the off side and does not middle it, ends up chopping it hard into the ground",
8.1,"Shakib Al Hasan to Sangakkara, 1 run, flatter and fuller, driven to the right of long-off and they jog the single",
8.2,"Shakib Al Hasan to Babar Azam, 1 run, sliding in with the arm, on a length, punched away between long-on and deep midwicket",

8.4,"Shakib Al Hasan to Babar Azam, 1 run, slightly short of a length, uses the angle and punches it down to long-on",
8.5,"Shakib Al Hasan to Sangakkara, 1 run, floats it up this time and gives some width outside off, Sangakkara gets down on one knee and nails a sweep but ther eis a man guarding the deep square leg fence",
8.6,"Shakib Al Hasan to Babar Azam, OUT, advances down the ground and tries to loft this one over mid-on but he does not get the desired distance. Sends it in the direction of long-on where Hasan ali gets down forward and snaffles a sharp catch. That was really travelling and the fielder did well",['Babar Azam c Hasan Ali b Shakib Al Hasan 46 (38b 6x4 1x6) SR: 121.05']
9.1,"Shahid Afridi to Sangakkara, 1 run, pushes it across the left-hander on a fullish length from over the stumps and Sangakkara comes forward and pushes it into the off side",
9.2,"Shahid Afridi to Gayle, no run, left alone outside off",
9.3,"Shahid Afridi to Gayle, 1 run, flat short of a length ball outside off, punches it straight down the ground off the backfoot. Solidly played",
9.4,"Shahid Afridi to Sangakkara, no run, floated up and pushed across at pace outside off, Sangakkara leans forward and drives to covers",
9.5,"Shahid Afridi to Sangakkara, no run, fullish and on the stumps, Sangakkara blocks off the front foot and the ball goes off the inside part of the bat to the left of Afridi who runs across and picks it up",
9.6,"Shahid Afridi to Sangakkara, 1 run, clipped out to deep midwicket",
10.1,"Iftikhar Ahmed to Sangakkara, no run, punched off the backfoot and Sammy at mid-off dives to field it",
10.2,"Iftikhar Ahmed to Sangakkara, OUT, Sangakkara's lovely innings come to an end. He's livid with himself as he walks away. Came down the track but could not get on top of that as it was not as full as he would have liked. Around the length area and he miscues the attempted lofted drive and sends it straight into the hands of long-off",
10.3,"Iftikhar Ahmed to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, tucked off the pads to deep backward square leg",['KC Sangakkara c Hasan Ali b Iftikhar Ahmed 28 (22b 3x4 0x6) SR: 127.27']

11.1,"Shahid Afridi to Gayle, 1 run, short ball, pulled away to deep midwicket",
11.2,"Shahid Afridi to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, flat and wide outside off, turning away, leans across and pushes it out to sweeper cover",
11.3,"Shahid Afridi to Gayle, SIX, that's Gayle for you, hardly seems like he has tried to hit that. Just swings, bat meets ball and it spars clean over long-off. Full and wide outside off, asking to be hit",
11.4,"Shahid Afridi to Gayle, no run, tries to pull and ends up dragging it towards the bowler",
11.5,"Shahid Afridi to Gayle, 1 run, flat length ball and tries to rush him with pace, Gayle knocks it to the left of Afridi into the leg side and they take the single",
11.6,"Shahid Afridi to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, short and wide, cut out to sweeper cover",
12.1,"Iftikhar Ahmed to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, length ball, sliding on leg, tucked away behind square",
12.2,"Iftikhar Ahmed to Gayle, OUT, oh, that's a super catch by Eoin Morgan at long-on. Made it look so simple but he had to do some work there. Gayle comes down the track and tries to clear long-on. Morgan takes it revese-cupped, had to push back slightly to get behind that and he plants the foot just in front of the boundary cushion. The momentum takes him further back, so he throws the ball up, crosses the rope, gets back in front of it and completes the catch. They go upstairs to check if the foot has touched the rope when he first takes the catch. But I think the issue is when he catches the ball a second time. But it all seems fine and Gayle is already almost out of the ground. The big screen flashes the big three red letters and Gayle's poor PSL continues",
12.3,"Iftikhar Ahmed to Bopara, no run, punched off the backfoot to covers",
12.4,"Iftikhar Ahmed to Bopara, no run, short of a length, more attacking line, on the stumps, drilled back to the bowler off the backfoot",['CH Gayle c Morgan b Iftikhar Ahmed 11 (9b 0x4 1x6) SR: 122.22']
12.5,"Iftikhar Ahmed to Bopara, 2 runs, short again and width on offer outside off, Bopara cuts square of the wicket. Sweeper cover runs across to the left but Bopara comes charging back for the second and completes it quite comfortably in the end",
12.6,"Iftikhar Ahmed to Bopara, 1 run, very tough caught-and-bowled chance, put down. Bopara tries to make room to pull this length ball but it is not short enough and he ends up dragging it to the right of the bowler. Iftikhar gets down to his right but cannot hold on to the catch. Had very little time to react as that was travelling",
13.1,"Shahid Afridi to Bopara, 1 run, worked to long-on off the backfoot",
13.2,"Shahid Afridi to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, drops it into the off side for a quick single",
13.3,"Shahid Afridi to Bopara, 1 run, short ball, swivels around and pulls but cannot get it past Iftikhar at deep midwicket",
13.4,"Shahid Afridi to Shoaib Malik, FOUR, oh, beautifully played. Width on offer and it is shorter in length as well. Malik waits for it before opening the bat face really late and just carving it through the square third man region. Exquisite",

14.2,"Imran Khan to Bopara, no run, slower ball, absolutely no pace on it. Bopara cannot guide it away square of the wicket as he opens the bat face. Plays the shot too early though he waited an eternity for it",
14.3,"Imran Khan to Bopara, 1 run, slower ball, does not pick the drop in pace and mistimes the drive. Misfield at cover allows a single to be taken",
14.4,"Imran Khan to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, goes for the wide yorker and offers up a dipping full toss outside off, still comes on at a decent height and it is played out to sweeper cover",
14.5,"Imran Khan to Bopara, no run, change of pace again. Bopara swipes hard against the line and the ball misses off-stump by a whisker as the batsman gets beaten",
14.6,"Imran Khan to Bopara, 1 run, low full toss, dabbed away off the pads to deep midwicket",
15.1,"Wahab Riaz to Bopara, 2 leg byes, rapped on the pads but seems like the impact was quite high. May have got an inside edge as well. He was looking to tuck this length ball away to the leg side but misses and the ball goes off the pad to the off side. Point runs in and fields it, fires a throw at the striker's end, misses the stumps. No one backing up and they get extra runs",
15.2,"Wahab Riaz to Bopara, 1 leg bye, tries to tuck to the on side but is beaten by pace and the ball goes off the pad into the off side again",
15.3,"Wahab Riaz to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, full and on the stumps, drops it to the covers region and sets off for a quick single",

15.5,"Wahab Riaz to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, full and wide, crashes the front foot drive through the covers region but straight towards sweeper cover",
15.6,"Wahab Riaz to Bopara, FOUR, walks across the stumps to this short ball and pulls it fine. Not a great effort from the fielder at short fine leg. Could have probably tried putting in the dive. Instead, he moves a step or two to his right and allows the ball to go past him",
16.1,"Imran Khan to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, backs away to make room early and pulls this short of a length ball to deep midwicket",
16.2,"Imran Khan to Bopara, 1 run, fuller ball, stays inside the line of the ball and drills it out to long-of",
16.3,"Imran Khan to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, clipped off the pads into the leg side",
16.4,"Imran Khan to Bopara, SIX, comes down the track and finally an attempt to clear the straight boundary produces the desired result. Gets right on top of that and that has gine miles over long-on. Humungous hit. ""as big as Ian Bishop,"" says Ramiz Raja on air",
16.5,"Imran Khan to Bopara, SIX, the keeper came up to the stumps after that previous ball but it does not matter as Bopara stays in the crease and whacks this straight down the ground. Too full again",
16.6,"Imran Khan to Bopara, OUT, goes for an almighty heave again and this time Bopara gets a leading edge that is skied towards the fielder at backward point. Maqsood settles under it comfortably. This one wasn't as full and is slower in pace which does it as Bopara tries to carve it over the off side",
17.1,"Hasan Ali to Shoaib Malik, FOUR, short and wide outside off, slapped hard square of the wicket. No one guarding the deep point fence and the ball crashes into the boundary",
17.2,"Hasan Ali to Shoaib Malik, FOUR, overcompensates by firing it too full this time. And there is a lot of width as well and Malik frees his arms and hammers a drive over the fielder at extra cover",
17.3,"Hasan Ali to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, even fuller this time and outside off again, almost a yorker this time and it is dug out through the covers region",['RS Bopara c Sohaib Maqsood b Imran Khan 30 (20b 2x4 2x6) SR: 150.00']
17.4,"Hasan Ali to Pollard, 1 leg bye, walks across early to try and flick this away to the leg side but wears it on the pad as the angle takes the ball in to him and the ball goes to square leg",
17.5,"Hasan Ali to Shoaib Malik, SIX, very full ball, went for a straight yorker but gets it wrong and bowls a half-volley on the off stump. That came out of the back of the hand but Malik picks up the drop in pace and stays leg side of the ball before thumping it down the ground",
17.6,"Hasan Ali to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, stays leg side of this one again before drilling it down to long-off",
18.1,"Imran Khan to Shoaib Malik, SIX, full, outside off, and it's lofted miles into the air over the cow corner fence. It's as though Malik knew what was coming from a mile ago and gets in position early, keeps the front leg out of the way and responds with an almighty swing",
18.2,"Imran Khan to Shoaib Malik, no run, slower ball, beats the edge of Malik's bat outside off as he fails to try and guide it away",
18.3,"Imran Khan to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, tries to slog and gets it off the toe end of the bat to deep midwicket",

18.5,"Imran Khan to Shoaib Malik, 1 run",
18.6,"Imran Khan to Pollard, 2 runs, slower ball, 97kph, Pollard nudge it to the left of the midwicket region. Calls for two and beats the throw at the striker's end",
19.1,"Wahab Riaz to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, fuller ball on middle and leg. Malik was leg side of the ball, so it comes on straight to him and Malik crunches it through extra cover",
19.2,"Wahab Riaz to Pollard, 1 run, wide ball, Pollard drags it from way outside off and sends it to long-on. Fetched it from a mile outside off and all he could do was to send it on the bounce to long-on",
19.3,"Wahab Riaz to Shoaib Malik, SIX, full, outside off, stays leg side of the ball. Gets the front leg out of the way and lofts it straight back over the bowler's head. Huge straight six",
19.4,"Wahab Riaz to Shoaib Malik, no run, goes for a slower ball yorker and fires a full toss. Malik miscues as he tries to fend it away to the leg side and they take off for the single. Pollard is sent back, however, and the bails are off at the bowler's end. They go upstairs and he is well inside",
19.5,"Wahab Riaz to Shoaib Malik, no run, short ball, tries the ramp shot after arching back but the bounce is too steep and Malik cannot put bat to ball. Not called a wide as the umpire seems happy with the bounce",
19.6,"Wahab Riaz to Shoaib Malik, FOUR, short ball, stays leg side and keeps the front leg out of the way before laying into a pull shot and the ball crashes into the deep midwicket boundary after bouncing in front of hit. Tremendous hitting from Malik, brings up his fifty as well",
