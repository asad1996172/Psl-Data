Ball,Commentary,Wicket
0.1,"Mohammad Irfan to Babar Azam, no run, pushes him back with a sharp, back of a length delivery on off stump. Babar defends",
0.2,"Mohammad Irfan to Babar Azam, no run, short and wide, hammers it to backward point",
0.3,"Mohammad Irfan to Babar Azam, no run, drives on the up and looks for a quick single to mid-off. Gayle had about as much interest in that run as he has in dying his hair pink",
0.4,"Mohammad Irfan to Babar Azam, no run, looks to hit hard, and mistimes a good length ball into the covers",
0.5,"Mohammad Irfan to Babar Azam, no run, back of a length on off stump, defends",
0.6,"Mohammad Irfan to Babar Azam, no run, racks up a maiden. Irfan's pace and his unerring accuracy around the off stump - coupled with Babar's nervousness at the crease, going at the ball hard, means he has failed to pick the gap with the drive. This time he finds point",
1.1,"Mohammad Sami to Gayle, no run, beauty. Gayle is pinned to his crease, aiming to defend a short of a good length ball moving across him. Seams away off the deck, past the outside edge",
1.2,"Mohammad Sami to Gayle, no run, opens the face against a back of a length delivery and finds point",
1.3,"Mohammad Sami to Gayle, no run, lets go a shortish delivery outside off. Islamabad not keen on giving drivable balls to Gayle",
1.4,"Mohammad Sami to Gayle, no run, 143kph, cramps him for room on off stump and Gayle can only poke it back to the bowler",
1.5,"Mohammad Sami to Gayle, no run, slugs a back of a length delivery to mid-on. Even making room and powering the ball - that too with Gayle on strike - results in a dot ball. First time that a PSL game has begun with 11 dots",
1.6,"Mohammad Sami to Gayle, no run, two maidens on the trot. Although really Gayle should have done more with this short ball on leg stump. Tries a leg glance and instead makes connection with thigh pad",
2.1,"Mohammad Irfan to Babar Azam, no run, back of a length and outside off, flashes and misses outside off. That's 13 successive dots to start the game",
2.2,"Mohammad Irfan to Babar Azam, FOUR, there's the first runs, with Babar taking a ball aimed at the top of off stump on top of its bounce and crashes it over wide mid-on. Tough place to access against a seven-foot tall seriously fast bowler",
2.3,"Mohammad Irfan to Babar Azam, FOUR, fends away a bouncer. It climbs up towards Babar's left ear and he plays a pull, instinctively. The man up at fine leg goes chasing after it, puts in a slide to try and drag it back, but he is unable to do so. Could be that he is worried about a collision with Pooran running to his right from deep square leg and they do collide",
2.4,"Mohammad Irfan to Babar Azam, FOUR, guides it to the third man boundary. Superb shot. All he does is let a short ball on off stump come on and gives it direction",
2.5,"Mohammad Irfan to Babar Azam, FOUR, full, straight, whips it to long leg. Effortless shot from Babar. This is perhaps the easiest boundary he's hit. Half-volley from Irfan",
2.6,"Mohammad Irfan to Babar Azam, 2 runs, moves around the wicket for a short delivery outside off, smacks it to the right of deep third man. Babar drags Gayle across for a second, and the throw, coming to the keeper's end is relayed across. Haddin hits direct but the batsman is safe",
3.1,"Rumman Raees to Gayle, 1 run, off the mark with a gentle little clip through midwicket. One off seven now",
3.2,"Rumman Raees to Babar Azam, no run, good length, moving across the right-hander, Babar pushes to cover",
3.3,"Rumman Raees to Babar Azam, FOUR, picks the back-of-the-hand slower ball, takes the risk of hitting across the line though. He has to make connection and he does. Enough to even beat short fine leg on his right",
3.4,"Rumman Raees to Babar Azam, 1 run, slaps a fuller delivery behind point. Not perfectly timed, and good effort from point as well, diving full-length to his left",
3.5,"Rumman Raees to Gayle, 1 run, dabs it behind square leg for his second single of the night",
3.6,"Rumman Raees to Babar Azam, no run, full on off stump, digs it out to mid-on",
4.1,"Mohammad Sami to Gayle, FOUR, that's in the slot. A length ball, giving the left-hander width to hit through. And he muscles it with that big bad bat through extra cover",
4.2,"Mohammad Sami to Gayle, FOUR, ooh, this is a better shot. Hits it through extra cover again, but this ball is short, and it's well outside leg, intending to cramp him up. But Gayle shifts beside the line and belts it",
4.3,"Mohammad Sami to Gayle, no run, clears the front leg again, Sami does better, hitting back of a length and preventing Gayle access to the off side. Mis-hit to mid-on",
4.4,"Mohammad Sami to Gayle, no run, pings a yorker on middle and Gayle just about keeps it out, off the inside half of the bat. Squeezes it through his legs to short fine leg",
4.5,"Mohammad Sami to Gayle, 1 run, backs away and heaves a slightly slower ball on leg stump to long-on",
4.6,"Mohammad Sami to Babar Azam, 1 run, takes a full ball on off stump and whips it through square leg. Risky shot, but he seems quite okay with that",
5.1,"Rumman Raees to Babar Azam, no run, a little roll of the wrists, but he seems to make sure while making contact, the bat is straight. So the full ball on off stump goes to mid-on",
5.2,"Rumman Raees to Babar Azam, no run, fuller delivery on off stump, whips it to midwicket",
5.3,"Rumman Raees to Babar Azam, 1 run, hangs back and drills a shortish delivery to long-on",
5.4,"Rumman Raees to Gayle, SIX, length ball on middle, Gayle goes deep in his crease, gets under the ball and puts it into orbit over the square leg region",
5.5,"Rumman Raees to Gayle, OUT, knocks him over! Looks for a repeat of the slog over square leg, but this time Rumman bowls it fuller, and pitches it outside off stump as well. In dragging the ball, Gayle gets an inside edge onto his stumps. The umpires check for the no-ball. It's all fine",['CH Gayle b Rumman Raees 17 (15b 2x4 1x6) SR: 113.33']
5.6,"Rumman Raees to Sangakkara, no run, back of a length on off stump, blocks",
6.1,"Shadab Khan to Babar Azam, OUT, strikes first ball! It's the googly, and the batsman has no clue. Shadab wheels away in celebration, utterly chuffed with himself. And so he should be. He has deceived Babar to such an extent that he plays down the wrong line, defending, looking for the legbreak and is instead pinned low on the front pad right in front of middle stump",
6.2,"Shadab Khan to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, it's the one that turns in again, but Malik picks it, helped perhaps by the length being short. Flicks to long leg",['Babar Azam lbw b Shadab Khan 25 (21b 5x4 0x6) SR: 119.04']
6.3,"Shadab Khan to Sangakkara, 1 run, drifts into the pads and he works it through square leg",
6.4,"Shadab Khan to Shoaib Malik, no run, tosses it up on off stump, Malik puts bat in front of pad to block",
6.5,"Shadab Khan to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, drives to long-off, lunging to get to the pitch of a flighted delivery outside off stump",
6.6,"Shadab Khan to Sangakkara, no run, seems to have picked the variation as Sanga leaves a good length ball outside off and it spins away further",
7.1,"Mohammad Irfan to Shoaib Malik, no run, back of a length and outside off, Malik is a little lead-footed. So his attempt the reach for the ball doesn't pan out",
7.2,"Mohammad Irfan to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, opens the face and guides the shortish delivery on off stump to deep third man",
7.3,"Mohammad Irfan to Sangakkara, no run, defends a shortish delivery on off stump. Sanga reluctant to come forward, worried about the bouncer from the seven-foot quick",
7.4,"Mohammad Irfan to Sangakkara, 1 run, works it off the base of middle stump to midwicket. Misfield from Watson",
7.5,"Mohammad Irfan to Shoaib Malik, no run, full toss on off stump, pushes it back down the pitch",
7.6,"Mohammad Irfan to Shoaib Malik, no run, beats him with a jaffa. It's back of a length, bites into the pitch and rears away past the angled bat that Malik uses to find runs at third man",
8.1,"Shadab Khan to Sangakkara, FOUR, ginger little poke on off stump as Shadab bowls a quick googly on off stump. Even a batsman of Sanga's class can't pick it. Outside edge for four to third man",
8.2,"Shadab Khan to Sangakkara, no run, tosses it up on middle and leg, Sanga looks for a cover drive, but gets an inside edge onto pad",
8.3,"Shadab Khan to Sangakkara, no run, shortish and outside off, goes for a cut, inside edge",
8.4,"Shadab Khan to Sangakkara, 1 run, flatter delivery outside off, heaves it to deep midwicket",
8.5,"Shadab Khan to Shoaib Malik, no run, spots Malik rushing down the track and bowls a really quick, really flat delivery on middle and leg. The batsman has to rush into putting bat down on it",
8.6,"Shadab Khan to Shoaib Malik, FOUR, pulls a flatter, quicker delivery on off stump and makes such solid connection that it screams to the square leg boundary. That is not an easy shot",
9.1,"Watson to Sangakkara, no run, back of a length on off stump, Sanga tries to force it, but his drive finds mid-off",
9.2,"Watson to Sangakkara, 1 run, back of a length and outside off, glides it to deep third man",
9.3,"Watson to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, taps the offcutter down to third man. Set up for the shot a bit too early and has to go through with it. Considering the length, it could maybe have been slogged over the leg side",
9.4,"Watson to Sangakkara, 1 run, sweetly hit. This is full, outside off and Sanga gets down with it and slices it through backward point",
9.5,"Watson to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, shortish and outside off, lets it come on and dabs it to deep third man",
9.6,"Watson to Sangakkara, FOUR, picks the gap to the left of deep square leg. it's all in how he waits on the slower ball to arrive on his pads and then the roll of the wrists gives it enough power to race away. Top shot",
10.1,"Shadab Khan to Shoaib Malik, FOUR, lovely shot, Malik spots the loopy legbreak, loves that it's attached with some width as well. Lays into a drive through point. Lazy fielding at deep point, Dwayne Smith puts (only) his foot down but it ain't enough",
10.2,"Shadab Khan to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, drives to long-off",
10.3,"Shadab Khan to Sangakkara, no run, tosses it up on leg stump, Sanga gets to it on the full and flicks to short midwicket",
10.4,"Shadab Khan to Sangakkara, no run, gets inside the line of a flighted delivery on off stump and drives to cover",
10.5,"Shadab Khan to Sangakkara, 2 runs, drifts down leg and Sanga works it to deep square leg.",
10.6,"Shadab Khan to Sangakkara, 1 run, drives to long-off to retain strike",
11.1,"Watson to Sangakkara, 1 run, back of a length on middle, whips it to midwicket.",
11.2,"Watson to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, flicks a length ball on leg stump to long leg",
11.3,"Watson to Sangakkara, OUT, mistimes the pull. Goes after the short ball, but makes connection off the bottom part of the bat, the consequence of going through with the shot too early. A catch bobbles over to Misbah at midwicket. A fuming Sanga walks off",
11.4,"Watson to Bopara, no run, fuller delivery outside off, drives to cover",
11.5,"Watson to Bopara, FOUR, flies away to the backward square leg boundary. Short ball, only rising to his stomach, and a short-armed jab takes care of the rest",['KC Sangakkara c Misbah-ul-Haq b Watson 17 (19b 2x4 0x6) SR: 89.47']
11.6,"Watson to Bopara, 1 run, back of a length on off stump, works it away through square leg",
12.1,"Shadab Khan to Bopara, 1 run, tosses it up on off stump, drives down the ground to the left of the bowler",
12.2,"Shadab Khan to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, quicker and flatter outside off, Malik plays the late cut to short third man",
12.3,"Shadab Khan to Bopara, no run, they are appealing for pad first and the finger goes up. Bopara asks his partner for check - which probably means he is not sure he's hit it - and then goes for review. It's the googly again. Bowled flatter and quicker and outside off. That makes Bopara shuffle across for a late cut and that means his front pad becomes prime target. Hits that first. Could the impact be outside off? It is. And Karachi probably have the first successful review in T20 cricket",
12.4,"Shadab Khan to Bopara, no run, dropped. This is a good length ball, the normal legbreak, Bopara goes back to drive through the covers, gets an outside edge. A teeny-tiny deflection to the wicketkeeper Haddin, who can't keep hold of it",
12.5,"Shadab Khan to Bopara, no run, googly again, and he is in line for an lbw again. Waiting deep in his crease, hurrying into the a straight bat shot to save himself",
12.6,"Shadab Khan to Bopara, 1 run, flighted on off stump, works it through midwicket. Fine spell from the 18-year old legspinner. Picked a wicket with his first ball, troubled batsmen through his spell of 1 for 23",
13.1,"Watson to Bopara, no run, comes down the track, but he is deceived by the slower ball. Lovely from Watson, beats Bopara on the outside edge playing a horizontal bat shot",
13.2,"Watson to Bopara, 1 run, reaches out to a full delivery outside off and slices it to deep third man",
13.3,"Watson to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, full on off stump, works it to midwicket and pinches a single",
13.4,"Watson to Bopara, 1 run, full on middle, pushes it down to long-on",
13.5,"Watson to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, short ball on middle, Malik pulls it to long leg",
13.6,"Watson to Bopara, FOUR, belts a half-volley down the ground to the long-off boundary. There is a fielder there, but he is too square to be of any use this time",
14.1,"Mohammad Irfan to Shoaib Malik, 2 runs, shortish and outside off, gives it a little touch, looking for the third man boundary, but Watson down there does well moving to his left",
14.2,"Mohammad Irfan to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, back of a length on off stump, works it through midwicket",
14.3,"Mohammad Irfan to Bopara, 1 run, blocks with the open face and a good length ball from around the stumps is sent to deep third man",
14.4,"Mohammad Irfan to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, cramps him up with a short ball but Malik somehow manages to pull it to deep square leg",
14.5,"Mohammad Irfan to Bopara, 1 leg bye, works it off his pads to long leg",
14.6,"Mohammad Irfan to Shoaib Malik, 2 runs, excellent shot. He doesn't have much room to work with, so makes some of his own and slaps a short ball on leg stump to deep cover",
15.1,"Watson to Bopara, OUT, fantastic catch and it's Shadab again. Hurtles in from the long-on boundary, dives forward, sticks out both hands and takes the ball only inches off the ground. The umpires are checking on the legality of it, but the soft signal is out. So a slow length ball, that ideally should have been crashed out of the city, is mistimed rather badly. Replays indicate it's a clean grab, with his fingers under the ball as he rolls over",
15.2,"Watson to Pollard, 1 run, steps down the pitch, and nudges a shortish delivery on middle and leg to long leg",
15.3,"Watson to Shoaib Malik, 1 leg bye, on the pads, flicks it behind square leg",
15.4,"Watson to Pollard, 1 run, pushes his hands at a good length ball outside off and finds a single at cover",
15.5,"Watson to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, OUT, short ball, pulls it to deep square leg. Goes for a risky second run, and a fantastic, flat, hard through may just have caught him short. Superb work from Asif Ali.",
15.6,"Watson to Imad Wasim, 1 run, hangs back on off stump, set to heave if it it's full over the leg side. But with it being short, he cuts to deep third man",
16.1,"Rumman Raees to Imad Wasim, SIX, wallops a back of a length ball over the man at long-on. That's more like it. Raees digs it in, only makes it rise up to the stomach and Wasim hits it as hard as he could. That's it. Just a brutal swipe",
16.2,"Rumman Raees to Imad Wasim, no run, that's well bowled. Nails the yorker on off stump and Wasim, having to slog every ball to get a good total for his team, can only dig it out",
16.3,"Rumman Raees to Imad Wasim, 1 run, another full delivery on off stump, squeezes it out to long-off",['Shoaib Malik run out 25 (23b 2x4 0x6) SR: 108.69']
16.4,"Rumman Raees to Pollard, no run, full and outside off, Pollard looks for a big drive over long-off and comes up with a whole lot of nothing. The back of the hand slower ball dips under the bat swing",
16.5,"Rumman Raees to Pollard, no run, now the bouncer, on middle and leg, Pollard avoids it",
16.6,"Rumman Raees to Pollard, 1 run, has to move out of the way of a leg-stump yorker and then flicks through to deep midwicket",
17.1,"Mohammad Sami to Pollard, 1 run, back of a length and outside off, belts it to mid-off",
17.2,"Mohammad Sami to Imad Wasim, no run, slots the wide yorker and Wasim is unable to do much with it. Looks for the glide behind point, but is beaten for pace",
17.3,"Mohammad Sami to Imad Wasim, 1 run, as hard as he tries to hit, the yorker on middle will only go as far as long-off",
17.4,"Mohammad Sami to Pollard, 1 run, backs away, and though he gets the length to get under this time, he mistimes the pull to long-on",
17.5,"Mohammad Sami to Imad Wasim, FOUR, that's unlucky for Sami. Pings the blockhole on leg stump, but Wasim gets an inside edge which bursts through his legs and to the fine leg boundary",
17.6,"Mohammad Sami to Imad Wasim, 1 run, low full toss outside off, slices it to deep point",
18.1,"Rumman Raees to Imad Wasim, OUT, caught on the midwicket boundary. It's Asif Ali again, taking it brilliantly. His work though is set up by a slower ball from Raees, on off stump. Wasim goes for the slog and he hits it high rather than long. Asif gets under the steepler and calmly takes it. Some needle between the bowler and the outgoing batsman",
18.2,"Rumman Raees to Pollard, OUT, two in two. Plants it full and outside off, Pollard drives it ever so elegantly to the fielder at long-off. Raees just stands and strokes his beard, like the schemer in an old-fashioned movie",
18.3,"Rumman Raees to Mohammad Amir, no run, oh, it could so easily have been a hat-trick. This is full, straight, looking for middle stump. But Amir defends with a straight bat",
18.4,"Rumman Raees to Mohammad Amir, 1 run, yorker on off stump, digs it out to extra cover",
18.5,"Rumman Raees to Sohail Khan, OUT, off stump knocked back. Spectacular yorker. Sohail is deep in his crease, hitting all across the line and his end is swift. Raees bails out of his followthrough, spreads his arms, looks down and soaks it all in",
18.6,"Rumman Raees to Usama Mir, 1 run, low full toss outside off, drives to extra cover for a single. Ends his spell, 4 for 25 from four overs",
19.1,"Mohammad Sami to Usama Mir, OUT, taken by mid-off running back. It's a low full toss - Sami going for the yorker - Mir looks to clear Raees inside the circle, but is unable to",['KA Pollard c Shadab Khan b Rumman Raees 5 (8b 0x4 0x6) SR: 62.50']
19.2,"Mohammad Sami to Mohammad Amir, 1 run, low full toss outside off, carves it to deep cover",
19.3,"Mohammad Sami to Usman Khan, no run, length ball outside off, he makes too much room as he slogs and ends up being beaten",
19.4,"Mohammad Sami to Usman Khan, OUT, middle stump lights up and Karachi have been bowled out inside their 20 overs. Yorker, thunders through the batsman's defences",
