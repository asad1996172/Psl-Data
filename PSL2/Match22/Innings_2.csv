Ball,Commentary,Wicket
0.1,"Mohammad Amir to Smith, no run, no feet as he pokes at a good length ball pitching on off stump and seaming past the outside edge",
0.2,"Mohammad Amir to Smith, no run, back of a length and outside off, taps it to cover",
0.3,"Mohammad Amir to Smith, 1 run, goes wide of the crease for the inswinger, but the line is on leg stump, allowing Smith to flick to deep square leg",
0.4,"Mohammad Amir to Asif Ali, FOUR, plays it beautifully. Calmly waits for the overpitched ball to drift across him and then lashes it behind point",
0.5,"Mohammad Amir to Asif Ali, no run, moves around the wicket for a good length ball, and this time Asif is very late to come forward and meet it. Finds cover with his ill-timed drive",
0.6,"Mohammad Amir to Asif Ali, no run, blocks a shortish delivery on off stump",
1.1,"Usman Khan to Smith, no run, back of a length on off stump, defends to cover",
1.2,"Usman Khan to Smith, FOUR, width on offer and Smith gets it up and over backward point. Stand and delivery stuff, and though it isn't perfectly well timed, with these short boundaries, it is enough",
1.3,"Usman Khan to Smith, no run, gets it to bouncer a bit more, and tightens the line on off stump as well. Blocks to cover",
1.4,"Usman Khan to Smith, no run, tries to flick a good length ball that is speared into leg stump. Only manages an inside edge onto pad. Wanting in footwork",
1.5,"Usman Khan to Smith, 1 run, nudges a length ball through midwicket",
1.6,"Usman Khan to Asif Ali, no run, works a fullish delivery on off stump past the left of midwicket",
2.1,"Mohammad Amir to Smith, no run, punches a back of a length delivery to cover",
2.2,"Mohammad Amir to Smith, 2 runs, in the slot on off stump, Smith heaves it over the midwicket. Probably could have hit it straighter",
2.3,"Mohammad Amir to Smith, OUT, what a catch! Sanga flies. He simply flies to his right and takes a one-handed screamer. Smith goes for an on-the-up drive through cover, only offers a thick outside edge and after that - considering it is such a massive deflection - Sanga takes centre stage. Leaps to his right, takes it right on the webbing. Then he brings the left hand over to steady it on as he falls to the ground. Fantastic from the 39-year old",['DR Smith c †Sangakkara b Mohammad Amir 8 (11b 1x4 0x6) SR: 72.72']
2.4,"Mohammad Amir to Haddin, no run, nice and tight on off stump, Haddin does well to get behind it",
2.5,"Mohammad Amir to Haddin, no run, hangs back to a short delivery outside off and chops it to point. Asif at the non-strikers' end thinks there is a single but he is sent back",
2.6,"Mohammad Amir to Haddin, OUT, chops on! That's a double-wicket over. No room for the cut. The bounce is too much as well. Perhaps he should have gone up and over the slips. But instead he goes for the shot through point, gets an inside edge and onto middle",
3.1,"Sohail Khan to Asif Ali, 2 runs, short ball outside off, short-arm pulls to deep midwicket",['BJ Haddin b Mohammad Amir 0 (3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00']
3.2,"Sohail Khan to Asif Ali, no run, back of a length and outside off, pushes it towards cover",
3.3,"Sohail Khan to Asif Ali, no run, top work from Sanga again, after Asif is beaten all ends up by an indipper. The batsman is shaping to cut a ball that isn't really short enough. Jags in off the seam as well. Only just misses off stump and the wicketkeeper dives to his left and gets a glove to it",
3.4,"Sohail Khan to Asif Ali, 1 run, works it through midwicket",
3.5,"Sohail Khan to Misbah-ul-Haq, 1 run, full on off stump, works it to the right of mid-on",
3.6,"Sohail Khan to Asif Ali, no run, shortish on off stump, he pats it down to mid-on",
4.1,"Usman Khan to Misbah-ul-Haq, 1 run, back of a length and outside off, serenely sends it down to third man",
4.2,"Usman Khan to Asif Ali, 2 runs, beats mid-on running back. This goes straight up with Asif looking to loft a ball on off stump without really getting on top of the bounce. Can't really be called a chance, Amir did everything he could to get under the ball, just isn't fast enough",
4.3,"Usman Khan to Asif Ali, 1 run, pulls to deep midwicket",
4.4,"Usman Khan to Misbah-ul-Haq, 1 run, back of a length and outside off, glides it behind point",
4.5,"Usman Khan to Asif Ali, no run, full and outside off, slugs it to mid-on. Very bottom-handed player",
4.6,"Usman Khan to Asif Ali, 1 run, tips and runs to midwicket, and considering it's Gayle there, it's a sound plan",
5.1,"Sohail Khan to Asif Ali, no run, mistimes a drive on the up to mid-off. Trying to hit the ball too hard",
5.2,"Sohail Khan to Asif Ali, SIX, picks up the short ball and pulls it all the way over deep square leg. Timely release for Asif, and the bowler has to be marked down for this. Bowls the length he can get under, and gives him the room to free the arms",
5.3,"Sohail Khan to Asif Ali, 1 run, back of a length on fourth stump, Asif is caught hopping as he defends. Inside edges it past the cut strip on the leg side",
5.4,"Sohail Khan to Misbah-ul-Haq, 1 run, gets in line with a shortish delivery outside off and dabs it right through Wasim at point. Misfield. He suggests the ball turned after bouncing in front of him",
5.5,"Sohail Khan to Asif Ali, FOUR, pummels it down the ground. That's the other length you can't bowl to a bottom-handed player: length with a tinge of width",
5.6,"Sohail Khan to Asif Ali, no run, slower ball outside off, defends behind point",
6.1,"Imad Wasim to Misbah-ul-Haq, 1 run, pushes it through on off stump, Misbah is able to flick it through midwicket. These sliders, that seem to race on after pitching, could make Wasim a tough bowler to face especially off the back foot",
6.2,"Imad Wasim to Asif Ali, 1 run, fuller delivery on off stump, drives to long-off",
6.3,"Imad Wasim to Misbah-ul-Haq, FOUR, hammers it to the point boundary. Superb timing from the captain. Sees the bad ball - short and wide, and waits on it just that little extra to beat the fielder on the point boundary, on his left",
6.4,"Imad Wasim to Misbah-ul-Haq, no run, shortish and outside off, cuts to point",
6.5,"Imad Wasim to Misbah-ul-Haq, no run, tosses it up on off stump, drives to extra cover",
6.6,"Imad Wasim to Misbah-ul-Haq, 1 run, full on middle, Misbah looms over it and flicks through square leg",
7.1,"Usama Mir to Misbah-ul-Haq, 1 run, shortish and outside off, cuts to deep cover",
7.2,"Usama Mir to Asif Ali, no run, tosses it up on off stump, Asif lunges forward to block",
7.3,"Usama Mir to Asif Ali, 1 run, dropped by Pollard at long-on. Comes running in from long-on, dives forward to try and get under the ball, and though he gets two hands to it, he spills it. Almost seems like he positions himself a little too far to the right of it. The ball didn't deserve a wicket - short and wide - and the mistimed pull shot threatened to give it one. Until Pollard intervened",
7.4,"Usama Mir to Misbah-ul-Haq, 1 run, full toss, flicks it through midwicket",
7.5,"Usama Mir to Asif Ali, 1 run, slices it through point",
7.6,"Usama Mir to Misbah-ul-Haq, 1 run, makes him reach with the square drive as he tosses the ball up and gets it to spin away outside off. Single through point",
8.1,"Imad Wasim to Misbah-ul-Haq, OUT, through him! What a strike. And it's the Wasim special. The arm ball, holding it with only the forefinger, aimed at a good length and skidding on. Misbah plays away from his body, offering a big gap between bat and pad and pays for it",
8.2,"Imad Wasim to Watson, 1 run, tosses it up outside off and drives through to long-off",
8.3,"Imad Wasim to Asif Ali, no run, length ball on off stump, he inside edges it back to the bowler",['Misbah-ul-Haq b Imad Wasim 13 (13b 1x4 0x6) SR: 100.00']
8.4,"Imad Wasim to Asif Ali, 1 run, nudges a length ball through midwicket",
8.5,"Imad Wasim to Watson, no run, into the pads, Watson misses the flick",
8.6,"Imad Wasim to Watson, no run, lobs it up on leg stump and it dips on Watson all of a sudden. Just manages to dig it out and the mischief maker Wasim sticks his tongue out. Thoroughly enjoying himself",
9.1,"Usama Mir to Asif Ali, 1 run, yanks a flighted delivery from outside off to deep midwicket. Slog sweep, a very awkward looking one, brings up the team's fifty",
9.2,"Usama Mir to Watson, FOUR, thumps a short ball on off stump to the deep midwicket boundary. Dew affecting the leggie",
9.3,"Usama Mir to Watson, no run, well bowled. It's flighted on middle, bringing the batsman forward. Watson is wary about hitting against the turn and so defends",
9.4,"Usama Mir to Watson, 1 run, full toss on off stump, smashes it down to long-off",
9.5,"Usama Mir to Asif Ali, no run, gets beside the nicely tossed up delivery on middle and drills it to cover",
9.6,"Usama Mir to Asif Ali, 1 run, short, wide, smashed, but there is protection in the deep. had he waited a little more, he could have found the boundary on Amir's left",
10.1,"Imad Wasim to Asif Ali, 1 run, flatter delivery outside off, drives to long-off",
10.2,"Imad Wasim to Watson, 1 run, flicks behind square leg as Wasim sneaks in that single-fingered arm ball again",
10.3,"Imad Wasim to Asif Ali, 1 run, works a quicker delivery on middle through to midwicket",
10.4,"Imad Wasim to Watson, 1 run, good length ball on off stump, defends, gets an inside edge towards midwicket and a misfield allows a single. Amir the culprit",
10.5,"Imad Wasim to Asif Ali, 1 run, nudges a full delivery from outside off to deep backward square leg",
10.6,"Imad Wasim to Watson, OUT, cleans him up! Karachi keep fighting. And Watson, coming forward to drive with a closed face, isn't there quick enough. The ball sneaks under his bat, hits the pad and then onto the stumps",
11.1,"Usama Mir to Asif Ali, FOUR, sweeps past the man at short fine leg. Excellent stroke. He sees Gayle is the fielder there and he isn't the quickest movers. Didn't really have a chance in the first place, with Asif finding the gap to his left.",
11.2,"Usama Mir to Asif Ali, 1 run, tosses it up on off stump, works it through midwicket",
11.3,"Usama Mir to Shadab Khan, 1 run, shortish delivery outside off, cuts to deep point",['SR Watson b Imad Wasim 8 (9b 1x4 0x6) SR: 88.88']
11.4,"Usama Mir to Asif Ali, 1 run, shifts his weight back, and to the leg side, to cut to point",
11.5,"Usama Mir to Shadab Khan, OUT, caught at cover. Couldn't have picked out the fielder better. Innocuous delivery. Almost a half-volley really. Could have smashed it. But instead he pops it to Bopara",
11.6,"Usama Mir to Pooran, 1 run, tosses it up on leg stump, whips it to long-on",
12.1,"Imad Wasim to Pooran, no run, pushes it through on leg stump, Pooran makes a conscious effort to block with a straight bat",
12.2,"Imad Wasim to Pooran, OUT, massive appeal for lbw and it's been given. Wasim is running through them. Is Pooran going to review? He really should because this may go down leg. And finally, they go for the check. It's the pace again, beating the batsman, especially with him playing a cross-bat shot over midwicket. No bat. Ball-tracking says it clips leg stump and the umpire's call of out is upheld",
12.3,"Imad Wasim to Amad Butt, no run, fuller delivery outside off, defends",['Shadab Khan c Bopara b Usama Mir 1 (2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50.00']
12.4,"Imad Wasim to Amad Butt, 1 leg bye, works it off middle with a flick, which is dangerous with Wasim skidding the ball through",

12.6,"Imad Wasim to Amad Butt, 2 runs, fuller delivery on middle, nudges it away towards long leg. Finishes an excellent spell, 3 for 18 while defending 126",
13.1,"Usama Mir to Asif Ali, 1 run, smacks a flatter, quicker delivery to deep point",
13.2,"Usama Mir to Amad Butt, 1 run, goes back and whips a short delivery to long leg",
13.3,"Usama Mir to Asif Ali, OUT, that's gorgeous. The set batsman Asif tries to be a bit cheeky, going deep in his crease to try and late cut the ball, but he waits for too long. Basically guides the ball into the keeper's gloves, undone by a little more turn than he expects. Usama Mir sets off on a jaunt. Good work from Sanga too, to rise with the ball",
13.4,"Usama Mir to Mohammad Sami, OUT, appeal for lbw and Usama is certain about it. The umpire isn't so gives the benefit of the doubt to the batsman. Asks the review. This is a really full delivery on off stump, Sami comes forward to block, and he does so down the wrong line. The bat is beside the ball with him playing for turn. There isn't much, and because of that it hits pad first. This could be gone. Ball-tracking gives up all reds and Sami is outta here",
13.5,"Usama Mir to Rumman Raees, no run, tosses it up wide outside off, he lets it go",
13.6,"Usama Mir to Rumman Raees, no run, flatter delivery on middle, defends. That's the end of another top spell from a Karachi spinner, despite the palpable dew - 3 for 24",
14.1,"Sohail Khan to Amad Butt, no run, back of a length on off stump, blocks it",
14.2,"Sohail Khan to Amad Butt, no run, oh dear, this should be a run-out. Karachi have two cracks at it because Raees has slipped. The throw from cover misses. Then Raees, who has lost his bat, has to scramble on his knees to reach his ground on the second throw from midwicket",
14.3,"Sohail Khan to Amad Butt, FOUR, smacks a back of a length ball on off stump to the long-on boundary",['Asif Ali c †Sangakkara b Usama Mir 39 (36b 3x4 1x6) SR: 108.33']
14.4,"Sohail Khan to Amad Butt, OUT, plays all around the slower ball, it's back of the hand too, and the stumps are shattered. Just your average tail-ender hitting right across a striaght delivery",['Mohammad Sami lbw b Usama Mir 0 (1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00']
14.5,"Sohail Khan to Mohammad Irfan, no run, full and straight, and somehow Irfan keeps it out",
14.6,"Sohail Khan to Mohammad Irfan, no run, full on off stump, defends",
15.1,"Mohammad Amir to Rumman Raees, no run, back of a length and outside off, he cuts and misses",
15.2,"Mohammad Amir to Rumman Raees, OUT, taken by long-on running to his left and Karachi are through. The defending champions Islamabad crash out, failing to chase 127. Length ball, skews it over the top and once the catch is taken, Amir borrows Raees' wicket celebration. Just standing there, tipping his head to the side and folding his arms.",
