0.1,"Mohammad Hafeez to Shahzaib Hasan, no run, tossed up on middle, grips and spins back in to hit Hasan high on the thigh pad as he looks to defend",
0.2,"Mohammad Hafeez to Shahzaib Hasan, no run, pushed through quicker on middle, Hasan is back inside the crease as he defends back down the pitch",
0.3,"Mohammad Hafeez to Shahzaib Hasan, OUT, poor, very very poor. Looks to hit this out of the stadium, but pick out Jordan, who has bucket hands, at long-on. Didn't get to the pitch of the ball as he stepped out, got more elevation than distance. As far as catches go, Jordan couldn't have asked for an easier one at the boundary.",['Shahzaib Hasan c Jordan b Mohammad Hafeez 0 (3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00']
0.4,"Mohammad Hafeez to Gayle, 1 run, flatter one on middle and leg from around the stumps, turned wide of midwicket to get off the mark",
0.5,"Mohammad Hafeez to Babar Azam, no run, steps out but is still made to reach out, driven but straight to mid-off. Good flight from Hafeez",
0.6,"Mohammad Hafeez to Babar Azam, 1 run, works it with the spin to long-on. Excellent first over",
1.1,"Hasan Ali to Babar Azam, no run, gets this to shape away from outside off, left alone",
1.2,"Hasan Ali to Babar Azam, no run, angles one back in from wide of the crease, defended back with soft hands",
1.3,"Hasan Ali to Babar Azam, OUT, he dropped a sitter last night, but has more than made up for it now. Babar slashes, but can only manage a thick edge. Believe me, it was flying and looked almost certain to beat Sammy on the dive at slip, but no! He stretched full length to his right and plucked it out. Sensational stuff. What's even more amazing is that he held on even as his elbows touched the ground. What control, simply outstanding.",
1.4,"Hasan Ali to Sangakkara, 2 runs, starts off with a sumptuous cover drive. Leans forward and caresses it into the gap between cover and point. Lovely timing",['Babar Azam c Sammy b Hasan Ali 1 (5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 20.00']
1.5,"Hasan Ali to Sangakkara, 2 runs, slides a length ball into middle and leg, tucked away into the gap at deep backward square leg. Sanga up and away in a jiffy",
1.6,"Hasan Ali to Sangakkara, no run, solidly behind the line of that full delivery that jags away from middle.",
2.1,"Mohammad Hafeez to Gayle, no run, pushed through quicker on middle, defended back down the pitch",
2.2,"Mohammad Hafeez to Gayle, no run, look to fire this in but the ball slips out perhaps. Lobbed over Gayle's waist as he looks to swing this over deep midwicket, but couldn't generate much power. Surely a no-ball? Umpire doesn't think so. Hafeez quickly apologises",
2.3,"Mohammad Hafeez to Gayle, 1 run, eases it into the gap at cover and walks the single",
2.4,"Mohammad Hafeez to Sangakkara, no run, punched off the back foot to Boom Boom Afridi at extra cover",
2.5,"Mohammad Hafeez to Sangakkara, 1 run, fired in full on the pads, tucked to square leg",
2.6,"Mohammad Hafeez to Gayle, no run, drifting in from wide of the crease, Gayle gets a good stride forward to smother the spin",
3.1,"Jordan to Sangakkara, OUT, he's pulled this straight to midwicket, would you believe it? Jordan won't mind that. Not the kind of delivery that generally fetches you a wicket against a batsman of Sanga's class and quality, really. Short, he looks to take him on with the pull but didn't close the bat face. The timing was off as well and Hafeez managed to take it easily in front of square, near the umpire.",
3.2,"Jordan to Shoaib Malik, no run, nips away off the seam from off, defended carefully",
3.3,"Jordan to Shoaib Malik, no run, gets behind the line of that length ball and bunts it to mid-on",['KC Sangakkara c Mohammad Hafeez b Jordan 5 (6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 83.33']
3.4,"Jordan to Shoaib Malik, FOUR, delightful straight drive, shows the full face of the bat to ease that down the ground. It was a half-volley that deserved to be put away, superb balance from Malik",
3.5,"Jordan to Shoaib Malik, no run, angles a length ball into middle from wide of the crease, bunted back down the pitch",
3.6,"Jordan to Shoaib Malik, no run, uppish but on the bounce to the cover fielder",

4.2,"Mohammad Hafeez to Gayle, no run, flatter and fuller on middle and leg, turned to short midwicket",
4.3,"Mohammad Hafeez to Gayle, no run, driven but straight to Morgan at cover. Pressure building. Is the release shot coming?",
4.4,"Mohammad Hafeez to Gayle, OUT, as plumb as they come, and this is a big moment in the match. Bowls the slider from around the stumps, Gayle plays for the turn but there is none. He's struck right in front of middle. That is a straightforward decision, really. You could sense Gayle was edgy, he's never comfortable facing the spinners early on, and the ploy of using Hafeez has worked for Sammy. Karachi in tatters now",
4.5,"Mohammad Hafeez to Bopara, 2 runs, cut away, into the gap between cover and point. Too short and he picked the length early",
4.6,"Mohammad Hafeez to Bopara, 1 run, slides one on off stump, punched past point for a quick single",
5.1,"Hasan Ali to Bopara, 2 runs, delightful square drive on the up, third man comes around with a tumbling stop. That was travelling",['CH Gayle lbw b Mohammad Hafeez 2 (9b 0x4 0x6) SR: 22.22']
5.2,"Hasan Ali to Bopara, FOUR, thick edge, and Kamran Akmal has failed to get his gloves to it. Reacted late, but it was still a catch. Poor footwork, you have to say. This was definitely the keeper's catch. Reprieve for Bopara",
5.3,"Hasan Ali to Bopara, FOUR, what does Bopara do to add insult to injury? Hops back and whips a length ball on middle into the square leg boundary. Sensational timing and use of the bottom hand to generate power",
5.4,"Hasan Ali to Bopara, 1 run, stretches forward, opens the bat face slightly and eases this behind point",
5.5,"Hasan Ali to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, looks to play a flat-batted pull, but the ball got big on him. Toe-ended it to short midwicket",
5.6,"Hasan Ali to Bopara, 1 run, mixes his pace up with an off cutter, Bopara taps it towards point and scampers across for a quick single",

6.3,"Shahid Afridi to Bopara, 1 run, too short, crunched off the back foot to sweeper cover as they jog the single",
6.4,"Shahid Afridi to Shoaib Malik, no run, slider that beats Malik's attempted whip, hit high on the left pad",
6.5,"Shahid Afridi to Shoaib Malik, no run, tossed up outside off, there's a bit of grip and turn, driven to point this time",
6.6,"Shahid Afridi to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, pushed to point, the non-striker called for the run and made it in the nick of time. The throw wasn't the best one either.",
7.1,"Wahab Riaz to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, slips in a length ball across the batsman, punched to deep point",
7.2,"Wahab Riaz to Bopara, no run, play and a miss. Short and angling away, looked to ease it behind point but was beaten for pace",
7.3,"Wahab Riaz to Bopara, no run, uppish drive, but on the bounce to backward point",
7.4,"Wahab Riaz to Bopara, no run, slower delivery, the batsman is deceived and pokes at the away-going delivery. There was some noise, some deivation too. Sammy went up in an appeal, Wahab ran through the length of the pitch, but Kamran Akmal didn't appeal. Perhaps he thought there was nothing. Umpire wasn't convinced either.",
7.5,"Wahab Riaz to Bopara, no run, flayed away but an outstanding stop at backward point by Hafeez",
7.6,"Wahab Riaz to Bopara, 1 run, controls the pull nicely, down to deep square leg",
8.1,"Shahid Afridi to Bopara, 1 run, drifts in a short ball on middle, he makes room and crunches it to deep point",
8.2,"Shahid Afridi to Shoaib Malik, 2 runs, gets to the pitch of the ball and eases it into the gap behind square on the off side",
8.3,"Shahid Afridi to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, flipper this time on middle, he's hurried into an attempted push, just about manages to get some bat on it as it rolls to Afridi's right, they steal a single",
8.4,"Shahid Afridi to Bopara, 1 run, too full and down the leg side, nurdled to square leg",
8.5,"Shahid Afridi to Shoaib Malik, no run, grip, turn and bounce, he gets on top of the bounce and defends it back down the pitch",
8.6,"Shahid Afridi to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, misfield at point allows a single",
9.1,"Jordan to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, short of length delivery that rears up on off stump, Malik gets on top of the bounce and fends it to the off side",
9.2,"Jordan to Bopara, 1 leg bye, errs in line, slides this down leg but is lucky to get away. Bopara looks to flick behind square but can only get some pad on it as they take a run off the deflection",
9.3,"Jordan to Shoaib Malik, FOUR, pulled imperiously! Just fractionally short, Malik was ready for it as he put that away in front of square. Little press forward, then swivelled back and found his timing",
9.4,"Jordan to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, uses the pace of the bowler to steer this down to third man",
9.5,"Jordan to Bopara, no run, off-cutter this time, not much change in action, defended back gently",
9.6,"Jordan to Bopara, 1 run, short, wide and he's crunched that to deep point",
10.1,"Shahid Afridi to Bopara, no run, peach of a delivery that squares Bopara up. Plenty of fizz, this drifted in and spun away past the shoulder of the bat",
10.2,"Shahid Afridi to Bopara, no run, fired into middle from wide of the crease, squeezed back down the pitch",
10.3,"Shahid Afridi to Bopara, no run, too full to cut, still goes through with the shot and finds point",
10.4,"Shahid Afridi to Bopara, no run, play and a miss. This one's much slower through the air, plenty of revs as the ball pitches and beats Bopara's feeble push. Akmal breaks the stumps and appeals for a stumping. Bopara's back foot that was in the air for a second or so is back inside the crease.",
10.5,"Shahid Afridi to Bopara, 1 run, too full on the pads, driven to long-on",
10.6,"Shahid Afridi to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, turned to the right of Afridi, who runs across towards short midwicket",

11.3,"Mohammad Asghar to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, full toss on the pads, turned to long-on",

11.6,"Mohammad Asghar to Bopara, 1 run, gets forward and bunts this into the gap at cover",
12.1,"Shahid Afridi to Bopara, 1 run, too close to cut, goes through with the shot. Morgan moves to his right to cut that off",

12.4,"Shahid Afridi to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, looks to go down town but got too close to the delivery, squeezed to long-on",
12.5,"Shahid Afridi to Bopara, no run, jabbed hard to cover. Afridi is mixing his pace quite well here",
12.6,"Shahid Afridi to Bopara, no run, nearly chips a return catch. Looks to work it across the line, this one spun away just a touch and lands in front of Afridi, off a leading edge.",
13.1,"Mohammad Asghar to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, drifting into middle and leg, punched to deep midwicket",
13.2,"Mohammad Asghar to Bopara, no run, backs away to go over cover, but the bowler cleverly tosses this up well outside off, left alone",

15.1,"Mohammad Asghar to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, heaved across the line to deep midwicket",
15.2,"Mohammad Asghar to Bopara, OUT, didn't get underneath the flight, but went through with the inside-out stroke. Wanted to hit it over cover, but ended up giving catching practice to Jordan at long-off. Credit to the bowler for being brave and tossing the ball up in the end overs. This may not be a bad thing after all from Karachi's point of view.",
15.3,"Mohammad Asghar to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, looks to whip this away, looks like he managed a bit of inside edge, down to short fine leg as they complete a quick single",
15.4,"Mohammad Asghar to Pollard, SIX, lofted straight down the ground and into the first tier. Long-on was a mere spectator. Pollard didn't look happy at being told what to do. Took out the anger on the ball.",
15.5,"Mohammad Asghar to Pollard, 1 run, grip and turn from off stump, bunted to the off side for a quick single",
15.6,"Mohammad Asghar to Shoaib Malik, SIX, another biggie. This one's too full, he advances, gets underneath the flight and boom! Over long-on again. Sania Mirza, in the stands, gives her nod of approval to the shot. Excellent use of the feet to get to the pitch of the ball.",['RS Bopara c Jordan b Mohammad Asghar 33 (40b 3x4 0x6) SR: 82.50']

16.3,"Hasan Ali to Pollard, 1 run, pulled but didn't get hold of it as much as he would have liked, long-on comes in quickly to cut that off",
16.4,"Hasan Ali to Shoaib Malik, 2 runs, top edge and put down by Afridi, who was running back from short fine leg. The ball was swirling around for a long time, he did well to keep his eyes on the ball, but somehow lost control as it was descending rapidly. Got a touch away from him too and he grassed it in the end.",
16.5,"Hasan Ali to Shoaib Malik, FOUR, makes room and slaps the short ball into the cover boundary. Pure muscle",

17.1,"Wahab Riaz to Shoaib Malik, OUT, looked to swing this over long-on, could only manage a thin nick through to the keeper. Wahab is quick. This was full and angling away, Malik was completely beaten for pace. End of a handy knock nevertheless",

17.3,"Wahab Riaz to Imad Wasim, OUT, why would you try to go for the big hits when all you need to do is give strike to Pollard? Beyond me.

18.1,"Jordan to Mohammad Amir, 1 run, flays an away-going length delivery to deep point",
18.2,"Jordan to Pollard, SIX, Wahab at fine leg was briefly in business, but this was struck really well by Pollard. Sailed over the ropes. Too short, he was in position quickly and pulled him behind square.",['Imad Wasim c Sammy b Wahab Riaz 0 (2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00']
18.3,"Jordan to Pollard, 1 run, hit really hard but Jordan, on his followthrough, gets some hand on it and deflects it down to long-on",

19.5,"Wahab Riaz to Pollard, no run, pulled in front of square, straight to deep midwicket",
19.6,"Wahab Riaz to Pollard, FOUR, this is precisely why he refused the single off the previous delivery. Too short, this was also a slower variation which Pollard read off the hand, waited and then rolled his wrists over the pull to pick the gap at deep backward square leg",
