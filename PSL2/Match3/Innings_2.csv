0.1,"Mohammad Amir to Mohammad Hafeez, no run, oooooooh, this was very, very close. His heart would have been fluttering, I can tell you. Full and swinging back in, Hafeez looks to work this across the line and is hit on the pad. Umpire reckons that may have missed leg. On replays, I must say it's a superb decision",
0.2,"Mohammad Amir to Mohammad Hafeez, no run, gets a good stride forward and defends the full delivery on off stump",

0.4,"Mohammad Amir to Mohammad Hafeez, OUT, goodbye, and goodnight Hafeez. First ball last night, fourth ball today. This is a beauty from Amir. The ball nips back in, this was a touch fuller, he made the cardinal sin of trying to work this across the line, missed it completely and was plumb in front of middle and leg.",['Mohammad Hafeez lbw b Mohammad Amir 0 (4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00']
0.5,"Mohammad Amir to Kamran Akmal, no run, shapes back in from off stump, Kamran is late on it but manages to squeeze this back to Amir",
0.6,"Mohammad Amir to Kamran Akmal, no run, through him. Cuts him into two halves. Phew! Length ball that jags back in off the seam to beat Akmal's push away from the body. After it passed the bat, the ball deviated in a long way and Sanga had to dive full length to his left to stop that. Superb delivery, great effort behind the stumps. Exceptional first over",
1.1,"Sohail Khan to Malan, no run, walks across the stumps and defends the in-swinger to midwicket",

1.3,"Sohail Khan to Kamran Akmal, no run, big shout for lbw as Kamran walks across the stumps to flick. He was hit on the pad, but the angle may have taken it down the leg side. Good decision in the end, but worth a shout nonetheles",

1.6,"Sohail Khan to Kamran Akmal, OUT, what a strange, but beautiful game cricket is. In the form of his life yesterday. Fetched him 88 fine runs. Little less than 24 hours later, he has to walk back for a duck. Looks to pull but the ball gets big on him, he is caught in an awkward tangle. Miscues this straight to mid-on",
2.1,"Mohammad Amir to Malan, no run, outstanding, tails this away late to square Malan up on the full-length delivery. Sensational display of swing bowling this",['Kamran Akmal c Imad Wasim b Sohail Khan 0 (6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00']

3.4,"Sohail Khan to Morgan, FOUR, too much width this time and he's crashed that behind point. Super timing from Morgan",
3.5,"Sohail Khan to Morgan, FOUR, steps out and wallops this wide of mid-on! Didn't get hold of it completely but had just enough to clear the infield. He gave him the charge to negate that late swing, the ploy worked this time",

4.6,"Mohammad Amir to Morgan, FOUR, fast hands, mindblowing hand-eye coordination. Short of length but not much width, I really don't know how he managed to open up that big a gap to flay that away behind point. Third man hardly moved by the time the ball reached the boundary",

5.5,"Shoaib Malik to Malan, FOUR, spanking drive, this time to the left of cover. Mid-off had no chance either, as did the man at the boundary. Not all that full, didn't get to the pitch in fact, but still went through with the drive and struck it well",

8.5,"Imad Wasim to Malan, OUT, pressure was building, Malan goes for a wild slog and has picked out Babar Azam, who takes an excellent catch at deep midwicket. The ball was dying on him but he ran in and then dived full length forward to complete the catch even as the ball was dying on him. There's still life in this contest.",
8.6,"Imad Wasim to Haris Sohail, no run, beaten by the drift. This one angles away to beat Sohail's drive. Sanga whips the bails off, was the back foot in? Looks so. He stretched a little too far forward, but the back foot was firmly inside the crease.",
